<h2>NOTES OF 1973 RESELECTION</h2><p>
This 1973 edition of "Hymns and Spiritual Songs" is not a revision of the Hymnbook.<a name=1:1></a> With one exception, it is a reselection of hymns that have appeared in the series from 1856, through 1881, 1903, 1932, 1951 and 1962.<a name=1:2></a><p>
Many changes were made in the 1951 and 1962 editions, and whilst some additions were made, a number of well-known and well-loved hymns were excluded, for various reasons.<a name=1:3></a> It is in response to a widespread desire for some of these to be replaced, that the present version comes.<a name=1:4></a><p>
Where appropriate a return is made to the original compositions of the authors.<a name=1:5></a><p>R.<a name=1:6></a>S.<a name=1:7></a><p>
