<h2>ACCOUNT OF THE 1856 HYMN BOOK</h2><p>
Upon this let the compiler's private account of his labours be heard.<a name=1:1></a> I was asked in 1856 to examine carefully some hymn books which were in common use.<a name=1:2></a> To do so was easy; to express my judgment faithfully, and yet not invidiously, was difficult.<a name=1:3></a> After consideration, I determined to give my judgment by this attempt at a book more suited for present need than any I know of.<a name=1:4></a> It rests with others to decide how far I have or have not succeeded.<a name=1:5></a> I may add that my rules while working were these:<p>
1. Retouch as little as possible, and with as light a hand as possible.<a name=1:6></a><p>
But, 2, allow to remain (a) no false, no faulty, no defective doctrine -- cost what it might; (b) no dispensational incongruities; (c) no want of keeping in the truth or truths stated; (d) no ambiguities between that which is and that which is not true; and<p>
3. Add as many new hymns as the Lord might enable me.<a name=1:7></a> I now leave my labour with the Lord.<a name=1:8></a><p>G.<a name=1:9></a>V.<a name=1:10></a>W.<a name=1:11></a><p>
