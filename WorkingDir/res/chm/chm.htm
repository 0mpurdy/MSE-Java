Charles Henry Mackintosh was born in October 1820 in Glenmalure Barracks, County Wicklow, Ireland. His father – a Captain in the Highlanders' Regiment – had served in Ireland during the Rebellion.
<p>
When he was eighteen young Charles was awakened spiritually through letters from his sister after her own conversion. He obtained peace with God through reading J. N. Darby's 'Operations of the Spirit', and learning that it is Christ's work for us, not his work in us, that gives peace.
He left the Establishment about 1839 and broke bread in Dublin. 
<p>
He opened a school at Westport in 1844, but gave it up in 1853 fearing that it was displacing the work of the Lord as his chief interest.
<p>
For some twenty-one years, Mr. Mackintosh edited a periodical, 'Things New and Old', in which many of his own writings appeared.
<p>
He departed to be with Christ 2nd November 1896.
