<h2>Reading the Volumes</h2>
To read a volume choose one of the options from the 'Books' menu and then click one of the volume links
on the subsequent author's page (e.g. Volume 1). This will take you to page one of the selected volume.<p>
Alternatively, click one of the underlined 'Contents' links on the author's page and then click one of the links in
the index. This will take you to the appropriate page in the selected volume.<p>
All Scripture references are underlined (hyperlinks), and clicking the reference will take you to the
appropriate chapter/verse in the J.N.D. and Authorized (parallel) versions of the Bible.<p>
You may also go directly to a book of the Bible by choosing the 'Bible'
option on the 'Books' menu and then clicking a particular book.<p>
Clicking the "go to synopsis" link at the start of a chapter in the Bible will take you to the relevant page of J.N.D.'s Synopsis.

<a name=search><h2>Searching the Volumes</h2></a>
Type the words you wish to search for in the text box. The search engine is case insensitive i.e. searching for 'heavenly'
will find all occurrences of 'heavenly', 'Heavenly' or 'HEAVENLY'. Any punctuation that you enter will be ignored
(except for possessive apostrophes &amp; hyphens).
<p>
Select the type of search from the 'Search Type' menu.
<ul>
<li>Phrase - will find sentences (or verses if searching the Bible) where the words occur consecutively
and in the order in which you have typed them.</li>
<li>Sentence contains words - will find sentences (or verses if searching the Bible) in which <u>all</u>
of the words occur in any order and not necessarily consecutively.</li>
<li>Paragraph contains words - will find paragraphs (or chapters if searching the Bible) in which <u>all</u> of the words occur in any order and not necessarily consecutively.</li>
<li>Page contains words - will find pages (or chapters if searching the Bible)
in which <u>all</u> of the words occur in any order and not necessarily consecutively.</li>
</ul>
<p>
From the row of check boxes choose whether you wish to search the Bible and/or volumes of ministry. You can
search more than one of them at once. Clicking the 'All' button (when one or more of the check boxes are selected)
will uncheck all the boxes, clicking 'All' again (when all the check boxes are unselected) will check all the boxes.
<p>
Finally, click the 'Search' button and then, after a short time (depending on the speed of your computer), the
search results page will be displayed. The first search of a particular author will be slower than subsequent searches
for the same author since the index needs to be loaded in the first search.
<p>
Clicking on one of the references on the search results page will take you to that reference. The matched sentence/paragraph
will be displayed at the top of your browser window.

<h3>Wildcards</h3>
If you search for 'delight*' then the search engine will find all sentences that contain <u>one or more</u> of the following words: delight,
delights, delightful, delighted and delighting. Likewise, if you search for '*boat' then the search engine will find all sentences
that contain <u>one or more</u> of the following words: life-boat, boat, lifeboat, pleasure-boat and church-boat. Finally, if you search for '*wait*' then the search engine will find all sentences that contain <u>one or more</u> of the following words:
wait, waited, waiting, waits, awaits, waiteth, awaiting, await, awaited and waiter.
<p>
Wildcard searches take considerably longer than normal searches.
<p>
The type of search selected in the 'Search Type' menu will be ignored during a wildcard search.

<h3>Refining searches</h3>
When you have completed at least one search, the Refine button will be enabled. This allows you to search the results of the
previous search. For example, search for the phrase "corn of wheat", close the results window, enter "contact with men"
in the search string field and then click the Refine button. A reference in JBS volume 7 will be found. Search for the
phrase "corn of wheat" again but this time enter "!die" in the search string field before clicking the Refine button.
This time the search engine will find all sentences that contain "corn of wheat", but don't contain "die". The results
of a refined search can be further refined.

<h3>Very Frequent Words</h3>
There are a number of words (about 200) that occur so frequently (more than 1000 times) in ministry that they have
not been indexed (for example: 'a', 'all', 'am', 'and', 'any' and 'are'). If these are the only words that you enter
in the search string then the search engine will return no matches.

<h3>Options</h3>
To modify the default behaviour of the search engine, choose 'Options' from the 'File' menu. The options window will be
displayed. There are two tabbed panes in the options window: General and Setup.
<p>
To stop the splash screen (the picture that comes up when you start the Ministry Search Engine program) being displayed at startup, uncheck (click) the 'Show splash screen at startup' option.
<p>
If you would prefer to load all the indexes at startup rather than when they are needed, then check the 'Load all indexes
at startup' option.
<p>
If you would prefer to search without using the index when the search string contains only 'Very Frequent Words' (see above),
then check the 'Perform full scan for frequent words' option. This will be a slow search since the search engine will need
to search each page in each volume.
<p>
If you would like more detail about how a particular search was performed, then check the 'Create log file' option. This
will make all searches slower. When the search is complete, return to this window and click the 'View Log' button to see
the details of the search.
<p>
If you do not have the Microsoft IE browser application installed in 'C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer' then you will
need to change the 'Default browser' option (on the Setup tab).
