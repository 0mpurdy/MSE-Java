<h3>Volume 1 - An Outline of Genesis</h3>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#3:18">Page 3</a>   It has something to say of the solicitude of divine <b>love</b> which would put forth its activities where all was ruin in order to bring about conditions which could be pronounced 'very good', and in which God could rest<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#11:14">Page 11</a>   There is a shining out of divine light from those who are walking in righteousness, holiness and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#13:4">Page 13</a>   But when the light of God is brought in, <b>love</b> and obedience are set in movement in an appropriate atmosphere, and sustained by suitable food, and under heavenly rule, and there is  life .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#16:5">Page 16</a>   But we may contemplate Him as the blessed anointed Man who moved in <b>love</b>  God-ward .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#16:11">Page 16</a>  And He dominates by <b>love</b>, for if He is the Image of God He is necessarily the setter forth of the <b>love</b> of God, for God is <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#25:5">Page 25</a>   We see the evil judged there too, and the death penalty attached to that tree coming upon One who bears it in <b>love</b>, to God's glory.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#28:1">Page 28</a>   How sweet is the revelation of God in <b>love</b>, and the shedding abroad of that <b>love</b> in the heart by the Spirit!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#29:14">Page 29</a>   The <b>love</b> of God in all its depth and full extent was made known there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#29:16">Page 29</a>   The perfect <b>love</b> of righteousness was seen there in One who would die to establish it, and such a hatred of lawlessness that He would die to remove it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#29:18">Page 29</a>   We see there, also, the <b>love</b> of Christ for the assembly expressed in the giving of Himself for her<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#30:2">Page 30</a>  As we come under the influence of Christ we are formed in appreciation of His <b>love</b>, who died not only to secure the good of His own but the possession of them for His own heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#30:3">Page 30</a>   We are formed, too, in the appreciation of the will of God, and of the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#30:9">Page 30</a>   But then He sees, too, a response to His affections, and an appreciation of the <b>love</b> of God, and that His interests are in the heart of the bride.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#30:11">Page 30</a>   As we come under the <b>love</b> of Christ we are formed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#31:11">Page 31</a>   We find this same distrust in ourselves, and we have to judge it, and we can do so now in the light of the fact that God has come out and has revealed His <b>love</b>, so that we might have unreserved confidence in unreserved <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#31:12">Page 31</a>   There is no reserve in God's <b>love</b>; He has given the best in heaven for the worst on earth, and in this way has rebuked distrust and established confidence, so that "the works of the devil" might be undone in our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#35:8">Page 35</a>   There are those in this world who are the seed of the serpent, though of course we could not point them out: the New Testament calls them the children of the devil, but there are also children of God on the line of righteousness and <b>love</b>, and there is enmity between the two seeds, but the enmity is on the side of the serpent and his seed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#50:4">Page 50</a>   In 2 Timothy we are exhorted to follow righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#51:17">Page 51</a>  The fact that it is mentioned that Seth was in the image of Adam suggests that what came in on the natural side was on the line of fallen man, and this brings out that it is through the activity of God's electing mercy and <b>love</b> alone that a seed is found in which His testimony can be continued.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#51:20">Page 51</a>   It emphasises the fact that God works according to His <b>love</b>, and His determinate purpose<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#54:11">Page 54</a>   After learning the complete ruin of man in the flesh as under death, we get spiritual acquisitions as we find everything blessed and glorious for our hearts in the shining out of God in grace and <b>love</b>, and in the establishment of all His thoughts of blessing in Christ, and as this is made good to us by the Spirit we joy in God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#62:10">Page 62</a>   If I <b>love</b> it I am not condemning it; I am not practically in the ark.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#64:13">Page 64</a>   "With thee will I establish my covenant" (verse 18); that is noonday light -- the light of what God is as pledged in grace and <b>love</b> to man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#64:14">Page 64</a>   Christ is to us the covenant; all God's <b>love</b> and thoughts of blessing man-ward are secured and confirmed to us in Him, and as being with Him in the ark -- in the separation of His death from this present evil world -- we enjoy the light of it, we live in the light of it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#65:3">Page 65</a>   But Christ as the true Noah is reverenced, the covenant is known and enjoyed; that is, the <b>love</b> of God made known in Christ who is the covenant.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#74:4">Page 74</a>   We find in  Ephesians 5  that the burnt offering is to be continued in the saints: "Walk in <b>love</b> as Christ has loved us and given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savour".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#74:5">Page 74</a>   Every step a saint takes in <b>love</b> is a continuation of the burnt offering.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#74:6">Page 74</a>   What will it be like when the fragrance of the burnt offering fills the world, and the <b>love</b> of Christ gives impulse to everything!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#77:13">Page 77</a>   He has brought the will of God and the <b>love</b> of God into death -- the only place where it could truly become food for us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#79:3">Page 79</a>   The burnt offering is the ground on which God can carry out the purposes of His <b>love</b> and enter into covenant.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#82:3">Page 82</a>   Our bow in the cloud is  Romans 5  and  Romans 8 ; when everything around you is wrong, you see the bow in the cloud; you see the <b>love</b> of God in Christ, and the <b>love</b> of God is shed abroad in your heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#82:6">Page 82</a>   Now a Christian may have sorrows and everything going against him; his wife sick, and his children delicate, his business not thriving; and yet he is happy in the sense of God's <b>love</b> and faithfulness in Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#82:16">Page 82</a>   So that you may have a peculiar sense of God's faithfulness, and that nothing can separate you from the <b>love</b> of Christ nor from the <b>love</b> of God; that is the bow.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#82:17">Page 82</a>   We do not learn how good God is by looking at providence, but we learn how good He is by looking at Christ and seeing Him to be the token of divine faithfulness, and taking in the blessed <b>love</b> that was revealed in the death of Christ<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#90:14">Page 90</a>   The Sun of righteousness is about to arise with healing in His wings, and the sons of Eber -- the pilgrim race -- look towards the east; they <b>love</b> His appearing.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#99:4">Page 99</a>   It is not only that they may be forgiven and justified through the grace of a Saviour God, but He would bring them into the place and relationship set forth in His Son as the glorified Man in heaven, and send out the Spirit of His Son into their hearts, that there might be the cry of 'Abba Father' in free and glad response to such amazing <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#99:8">Page 99</a>   How could there be anything greater than to have the knowledge and possession of the Son of God in heaven, and to know that His place and relationship are ours eternally, through the infinite grace and <b>love</b> of the blessed God?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#101:10">Page 101</a>   The Lord said, "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me; but he that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will <b>love</b> him and will manifest myself to him",  John 14:21 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#102:4">Page 102</a>   There was a hostile people occupying the territory of promise, figurative of those influences of evil (which really emanate from spiritual powers of wickedness in the heavenlies,  Ephesians 6:12 ) by which Satan would seek to hinder God's called ones from coming into spiritual possession of that which is in His purpose of <b>love</b> for them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#103:2">Page 103</a>   But the Lord says to each one of us, You will be known as a lover by having My commandments and keeping them; and if you <b>love</b> Me you will want Me, and if you want Me I will manifest Myself to you.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#110:4">Page 110</a>  It is much easier to lead people down to Egypt than to take the <b>love</b> of it out of their hearts when it has once come there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#118:11">Page 118</a>   The blessing that will fill the world of bliss is that the will of God is fully established by the One who said, "Lo, I come to do thy will"; so that the <b>love</b> of God can be displayed and enjoyed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#119:1">Page 119</a>   The loaf in the Lord's Supper speaks of the will of God established, and the cup speaks of the <b>love</b> of God made known and enjoyed: we have got it in the king's valley now.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#119:2">Page 119</a>   Christ brings in the will of God and the <b>love</b> of God; He  will  bring both in publicly, but saints have the refreshment of both privately in the king's valley -- a low place in this world, but where Melchisedec is known, and the blessing that is to fill a world of bliss is tasted.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#119:4">Page 119</a>  There is nothing more wonderful than the Lord's Supper, and nothing the devil has more deadly hostility to: he has made it sacramental to many, and just remembrance of what Christ has done to others; he has sought to cloud all the depths and sweetness and beauty of it, as that by which the Lord rallies His own and brings Himself and His <b>love</b> and the <b>love</b> of God livingly before their affections.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#121:10">Page 121</a>   That Person loves every one of us with a present, personal <b>love</b>, and we are bound up with Him in everlasting ties.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#123:10">Page 123</a>   To know Himself we must know His nature, and His nature is holy <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#123:12">Page 123</a>   If God's almighty <b>love</b> is near, how can His people lack anything that is good for them?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#129:6">Page 129</a>   We go through them in the light of His known <b>love</b>, and His <b>love</b>'s purpose.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#134:13">Page 134</a>   The influences of grace are brought to bear upon us by new-covenant ministry, the ministry of all that is the outcome of the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#134:14">Page 134</a>   The unfolding of what God is for us; His <b>love</b> concentrated at Calvary, and now diffused in millions of hearts here by the Spirit; so that there is a response to Him in free affections, and in the spirit of sonship.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#134:16">Page 134</a>   Then we can "by <b>love</b> serve one another".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#135:1">Page 135</a>   Saints are served because there is a powerful spring of <b>love</b> within that must express itself in service.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#137:20">Page 137</a>   If it says, "Thou shalt <b>love</b> the Lord thy God", it shows His nature, what He delights in.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#138:1">Page 138</a>   God is <b>love</b>, He wants me to <b>love</b> Him; He would not ask His creature to <b>love</b> Him if He were not <b>love</b> Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#138:5">Page 138</a>   They will see God in all His <b>love</b>: the unsubdued heart of stone that made them like Ishmael -- a wild ass of a man -- will become a heart of flesh: they will come under a new mother.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#148:4">Page 148</a>   "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you"  John 14:18 ; "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me; but he that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will <b>love</b> him and will manifest myself to him" (verse 21).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#148:5">Page 148</a>   "If any one <b>love</b> me, he will keep my word, and my Father will <b>love</b> him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him" (verse 23).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#149:16">Page 149</a>   If you look at feet-washing all through Scripture, it is always connected with refreshment and the service of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#151:3">Page 151</a>   For visitation we need a sense that we are orphans, and the breaking of bread sets forth that; for it means that the One we <b>love</b> has died; He is not here.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#151:7">Page 151</a>   In the assembly <b>love</b> is cherished and gratified, but faith is also confirmed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#167:7">Page 167</a>   That death was indeed the full manifestation of the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#167:9">Page 167</a>   Think of what He was to the Father, the One who could say concerning His death, "That the world may know that I <b>love</b> the Father, and as the Father has commanded me, thus I do",  John 14:31 !<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#167:11">Page 167</a>   He cherished them in His heart according to all the Father's thoughts in regard to them, and according to His own <b>love</b>, and He devoted Himself to them that all these precious thoughts might come into effect.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#167:12">Page 167</a>   And the Father cherished those affections which answered so perfectly to Him; they became surpassingly fragrant in that offering of Himself which provided a divine and holy basis on which all the purposes of eternal <b>love</b> could be brought to fruition.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#167:14">Page 167</a>   He has brought in the will of God -- the divine pleasure -- in all its full extent, and He has brought in the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#168:5">Page 168</a>   Then the Son, in all the fragrance of the Son's affections and obedience, devoted Himself to death that He might furnish the basis for the accomplishment of all the purposes of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#168:11">Page 168</a>   It was by man that sin and death had entered into the world, it was man who had disobeyed and dishonoured God and been a cause of grief to Him; and it must be Man who should go in obedience and devotedness of <b>love</b> even to death, to glorify God there in the fullest way, and to bring in perfect delight for Him, a sweet fragrance which will abide eternally<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#173:6">Page 173</a>   It has been truly said that Christ was held by the strength of His <b>love</b> to all the precious work that was needful for the glory of God and the gratification of the Father's heart, so that 'many sons' might be brought in.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#173:9">Page 173</a>   "The God whom we have known,  Well known in Jesus' <b>love</b>;  Rests in the blessing of His own,  Before Himself above".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#173:10">Page 173</a>   ( Hymn 72 ) Christ is the First-born among many brethren, who will be conformed to His image for the satisfaction of the <b>love</b> of God, and He gets the bride as the satisfaction of His own heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#174:2">Page 174</a>   In chapter 23 we have the death of Sarah, the vessel of promise; and now what comes to light is the purpose of the Father, and an object for the <b>love</b> of the Son -- the bride.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#174:7">Page 174</a>   But there was something prior to that, and greater than that; there was what God had treasured in His heart before there was any movement of sin; His eternal purposes of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#174:8">Page 174</a>   There were purposes formed when God had nothing to consider but His own <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#179:9">Page 179</a>   Then the church is the witness to Him of His Father's <b>love</b>, for she is the object His Father's <b>love</b> has secured to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#180:1">Page 180</a>   He saw that in His brethren which He could <b>love</b>, not only in a sovereign way but in a complacent way.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#180:8">Page 180</a>   Those who <b>love</b> what is of God, and are attracted to it whenever they come in contact with it, are material for the bride.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#181:8">Page 181</a>   I think this suggests a further endowment; the Spirit making the saints conscious of being set in the value of redemption, and in deliverance as its fruit, so that the <b>love</b> of God and the infinite thoughts of blessing to which that <b>love</b> has given birth can be enjoyed in perfect freedom.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#181:11">Page 181</a>   We know the price His <b>love</b> has paid that He might have us for Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#182:12">Page 182</a>   The gifts are a token of His <b>love</b> and deep interest in her, and every gift is really an expression of Himself, and in so far as we get the good of it we are adorned with what is of Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#182:13">Page 182</a>   The bestowal of gifts is a precious activity of the <b>love</b> of Christ, for the gifts are the evidence of His triumph, and the proof that He is alive.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#183:4">Page 183</a>   When we come to the Supper we are in the presence of the greatest thing in the universe -- the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#183:6">Page 183</a>   The Son has come in holy and perfect affections into the place of death, and has brought in His own <b>love</b> and the <b>love</b> of God, and as we drink into that there is bridal formation.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#183:9">Page 183</a>   But the <b>love</b> which is brought in is far greater than the sin which was put away; it is infinitely precious, and it forms the bride, for as we drink into it we are formed in bridal affections.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#183:11">Page 183</a>   He gave Himself in <b>love</b> for the assembly; all the fragrance and perfection of His Person and <b>love</b> came out in death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#183:12">Page 183</a>   "In that death all <b>love</b> was centred".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#184:1">Page 184</a>   His death is wondrous also because it is the expression of His <b>love</b> to the Father.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#184:2">Page 184</a>   "That the world may know that I <b>love</b> the Father".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#185:1">Page 185</a>   Invested with every precious token of the Father's wealth and of the <b>love</b> of the Son!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#185:3">Page 185</a>   The <b>love</b> of Christ comes especially before us in the Supper.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#185:4">Page 185</a>   There may be varieties in conditions of soul, but when we come together to eat the Supper the <b>love</b> of Christ, and the thoughts of His <b>love</b>, come into view for us all.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#190:15">Page 190</a>   It is the fruit of God taking His own course in sovereignty, and in grace, mercy, and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#191:6">Page 191</a>   Does he <b>love</b> the Lord and <b>love</b> His people?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#197:14">Page 197</a>  The digging of the wells in Abraham's time corresponds with the way faith and <b>love</b> laboured in the church's early days in order that there might be springs of divine refreshment; the apostles and many others laboured.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#201:6">Page 201</a>   It is what is suggested in 2 Timothy; what is opened up is the path of separation; we are to depart from iniquity even if found among those called by the Christian name; and we are to follow righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#201:12">Page 201</a>   If Christians walk in <b>love</b>, and enjoy the privileges that God has called them into, the world will have to recognise that God is with them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#202:4">Page 202</a>   All the features of <b>love</b>, devotedness, obedience -- everything that marked the assembly at the beginning and made her beautiful -- will come out in the end.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#207:11">Page 207</a>   It is not planning and contriving to gain some object for himself; it was divine planning, the sober calculation of <b>love</b> for the good of others.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#208:8">Page 208</a>   But they are beloved for the fathers' sakes, and the fathers were beloved because Jehovah chose to <b>love</b> them sovereignly!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#208:13">Page 208</a>   We had done nothing then, good or bad, so that if we had a place in His purpose it must have been wholly in sovereign <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#212:8">Page 212</a>  The Lord appealed to Israel, "I remember thee and the <b>love</b> of thy espousals".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#215:1">Page 215</a>   a son); a personal and confiding intercourse with God in the consciousness that He hears (Simeon -- Hearing); unity in the one Spirit and by the knitting together in <b>love</b> (Levi -- United); praise (Judah); abundant compensation for anything that may have been given up (Issachar -- There is hire); and, finally, the dwelling of divine Persons (Zebulun -- Dwelling).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#219:15">Page 219</a>   He has spoken to me in His grace and <b>love</b>, and put me on such confidential terms with Himself that I can freely address Him<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#223:9">Page 223</a>   It shows that the One who can care for the flock is the One competent to rule; He rules in the spirit of shepherd care, as having established His title by the service of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#224:6">Page 224</a>  Joseph was the peculiar object of his father's <b>love</b>, and his brethren knew it; there was evidence of it in the "vest of many colours".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#224:9">Page 224</a>   And all through how many-coloured was the witness given that He was the Object of the Father's <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#225:15">Page 225</a>  We are brought into the kingdom of the Son of His <b>love</b>; in that aspect the authority would be that of <b>love</b>; in His kingdom <b>love</b> must predominate.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#255:10">Page 255</a>   We are in presence of God revealed in infinite <b>love</b>, and there we can only be worshippers.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac1.htm#261:9">Page 261</a>   They did not really know him, nor believe in his <b>love</b>.<br>
<h3>Volume 2 - An Outline of Exodus</h3>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#1:1">Page 1</a>   Many of those "things concerning himself" are found in the book of Exodus -- a part of the Holy Scriptures peculiarly rich in typical teaching -- and nothing more is needed to make it attractive to those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#2:6">Page 2</a>   God would have His people for His pleasure and service, in free and glad response to His known grace and <b>love</b>; but Satan would seek in every way to detain the divine seed in thraldom to sin, or to the principles of the world in a legal or religious way.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#9:7">Page 9</a>  God had in His mind to free His people from the associations of Egypt, and from everything servile, that He might be served according to the pleasure which His <b>love</b> found in them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#13:2">Page 13</a>   "In his <b>love</b> and in his pity he redeemed them".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#13:3">Page 13</a>   There was pity for their distress and misery, but there was <b>love</b> which had covenanted blessing for them long before.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#18:5">Page 18</a>  God comes out to effect what will be for His pleasure -- to bring the hearts of His people under the influence of grace so that they may be formed in thoughts and affections which are responsive to grace -- and to give effect to all the purposes of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#25:9">Page 25</a>   The object of the revelation of God in grace is that He may have man for Himself, for the pleasure of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#26:7">Page 26</a>   Divine <b>love</b> has been fully and blessedly expressed with a view to our affections being purified.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#26:9">Page 26</a>   It is the pure in heart who see God, and we are exhorted to follow righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace "with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#26:11">Page 26</a>  As we follow the teaching of this book we shall find God speaking in chapter 20 of "thousands of them that <b>love</b> me", and in connection with the offerings for the tabernacle they were to be taken "of every one whose heart prompteth him" (25: 2).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#26:12">Page 26</a>   God was making Himself known that He might be served by a free people with purified hearts in full and glad response to His holy <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#34:3">Page 34</a>   The presence of the saints on earth -- as characterized by life in Christ Jesus ( 2 Timothy 1:1 ), faith and <b>love</b> which are in Christ Jesus (1: 13), the grace which is in Christ Jesus (2: 1), the salvation which is in Christ Jesus (2: 10), living piously in Christ Jesus (3: 12) -- is a standing miracle and a continual witness to the fact that God has intervened in grace to deliver men from all the power of evil here.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#34:7">Page 34</a>   In marked contrast to the mere imitators Paul could say, "But thou hast been thoroughly acquainted with my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, <b>love</b>, endurance, persecutions, sufferings" ( 2 Timothy 3:10 , 11).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#35:3">Page 35</a>   It is not too much to say that if all saints were living piously in Christ Jesus, and on the line of faith and <b>love</b> in Him, strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus, there would be such a testimony to the delivering power of God in grace as could not be gainsaid by anybody.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#38:8">Page 38</a>  So that if in the first two signs we have the moral state of the world exposed, and the uncleanness of man as a source of what is evil, in the third we have clearly intimated the introduction of life morally by the Spirit of God, so that His people may be found here in separation from the world, and in freedom from the power of sin and death, so as to be practically on the line of righteousness and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#50:7">Page 50</a>   The affections of all are nourished upon the One who in suffering <b>love</b> bore the judgment.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#50:10">Page 50</a>   As their hearts take in the thought of the <b>love</b> in which He bore the judgment due to them, they are brought into accord with that holy judgment.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#50:13">Page 50</a>  The bitter herbs speak of self-judgment wrought through grace while feeding on the <b>love</b> that bore the judgment.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#50:16">Page 50</a>   The fact that that man has gone in judgment in the death of Christ, and that divine <b>love</b> has reached us that way, becomes food for us<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#52:8">Page 52</a>   How different is it when Christ really comes before the heart, and one has been inwardly nourished upon the <b>love</b> in which He bore the judgment!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#54:7">Page 54</a>   Causing them to feed on Him in the <b>love</b> that bore divine judgment for them, and in the appreciation and appropriation of Christ forming their thoughts and affections in an entirely new character, so that they may be inwardly freed from the working of fleshly leaven, and found practically in the life of Christ!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#56:4">Page 56</a>   He has a distinct claim, and if we have really fed on the Lamb roast with fire, we shall be ready to sing "<b>Love</b> so amazing, so divine,  Demands my soul, my life, my all".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#56:5">Page 56</a>    ( Hymn 272 ) It is a willing surrender brought about by the influence of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#62:6">Page 62</a>  We see here a people sheltered from judgment by the blood of the Lamb, and nourished upon the One who in <b>love</b> bore the judgment, and now exercised to put all leaven out of their houses, and to move out of Egypt as wholly claimed by the One who had redeemed them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#66:7">Page 66</a>   God will bring in the beauty of Christ and make it the excellency and ornament of His delivered people, and He will spread over them the cloud of His protecting <b>love</b>.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#72:9">Page 72</a>   We are subjects of mercy; our deliverance is purely the fruit of divine <b>love</b> and wisdom, and of the actings of divine power.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#81:15">Page 81</a>   Do you not <b>love</b> to think of that life of holy obedience of Him who suffered for us in the flesh?<br>

<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#113:5">Page 113</a>   He had acted towards them in <b>love</b>, and had manifested His grace, so as to win their affections; He had, typically, made every provision for them -- the manna to sustain them in the path of His will, and the water from the Rock to keep them inwardly refreshed and invigorated in their affections.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#113:7">Page 113</a>   And who said again, "Oh how I <b>love</b> thy law .<br>

<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#114:9">Page 114</a>   His thought was to be near to His people and to bless them, so that they might <b>love</b> Him, and devote themselves in free affection to His service.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#118:1">Page 118</a>   Everything that absorbs man, so that God known in redeeming grace and <b>love</b> does not get His due place with him, is of the nature of an "other god".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#118:5">Page 118</a>  God has revealed Himself in grace and <b>love</b> that He might get the place that is due to Him in the heart of man, His poor fallen creature.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#118:7">Page 118</a>   He covers the returning prodigal with kisses, sheds His <b>love</b> abroad in the heart of the believer by the Holy Spirit given to him, and the Spirit who sheds God's <b>love</b> abroad in the believer's heart is also the Spirit of Christ -- the Spirit of the blessed Man who ever gave God His place, and who never took up the name of another into His lips.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#119:16">Page 119</a>   He must have a  great  company to <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#119:17">Page 119</a>   How strikingly is this set forth in the words, "showing mercy unto  thousands  of them that <b>love</b> me and keep my commandments"!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#120:3">Page 120</a>   It is always  in favour  of the thousands of them that <b>love</b> God and keep His commandments.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#120:4">Page 120</a>   Saints walking normally according to the Spirit in <b>love</b> and obedience have the comfort of knowing and proving that God's holy government is always in their favour.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#120:5">Page 120</a>   And even if we have come under the governmental consequences of wrong-doing in the past, from the moment that we begin to sow to the Spirit, and to continue in well-doing, the government of God begins to operate in our favour, and "mercy" comes in, so that there is often even some alleviation of what we suffer governmentally, while the suffering which remains becomes the discipline of <b>love</b> for our spiritual profit to promote our being partakers of God's holiness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#122:14">Page 122</a>   It supposes, of course, that the father and mother are amongst the thousands of those that <b>love</b> God and keep His commandments.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#122:17">Page 122</a>   His grace and <b>love</b> are known there, and His sway is known and accepted.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#124:3">Page 124</a>  The following commandments are summed up in "<b>Love</b> works no ill to its neighbour: <b>love</b> therefore is the whole law" ( Romans 13:10 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#124:16">Page 124</a>   For it suggests that in knowing the <b>love</b> of God, and in owning His Hand in everything, one may be free even from desire for what He does not give.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#125:3">Page 125</a>   Not knowing God, or His grace and <b>love</b>, they do not trust Him with their happiness, and are consumed with desire for what they see others possess, or with sullen discontent because they cannot have it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#125:8">Page 125</a>   According to the inward man the saint delights in the law of God, and as having the Spirit of Christ he is on the line of <b>love</b> and liberty, and not bondage.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#129:4">Page 129</a>   The altar speaks of a self-sacrificing <b>love</b> that goes beyond all that law required, and a ground of acceptance infinitely greater than any obedience of ours could be, however perfect.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#129:14">Page 129</a>   As the old hymn says,  "Of Abba's <b>love</b>, of God's great claim,  He came not short at all;  Perfect in everything was He,  Alone since Adam's fall".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#130:9">Page 130</a>   He has not gone out free with His body; He has devoted it; and in the giving of His body the Lord has pledged Himself to serve in <b>love</b> eternally.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#130:13">Page 130</a>   The great thought which the bread in the Supper presents is that He has devoted Himself in <b>love</b>, He has said plainly, "I <b>love</b>"; He has pledged Himself, He has gone to the post and had His ear bored.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#130:17">Page 130</a>   He has said plainly, "I <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#131:4">Page 131</a>   The effect of apprehending the <b>love</b> of Christ in this way would be that we look for everything from that service of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#131:10">Page 131</a>   His <b>love</b> is pledged in that.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#131:14">Page 131</a>   "This do for the calling me to mind"; we are to call Him to mind in connection with the <b>love</b> in which He pledged Himself to God and to us eternally.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#131:15">Page 131</a>  Revelation 5  speaks of Him as "a Lamb standing, as slain"; He bears in heaven the evident tokens of the suffering <b>love</b> in which He died.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#131:16">Page 131</a>   It is that side of it there; He carries the tokens of suffering <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#132:1">Page 132</a>   Here it is the token of serving <b>love</b>; the same <b>love</b> that suffered, now serves eternally.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#132:7">Page 132</a>   He can make us sit down in the restfulness of the <b>love</b> of God and the Father, and minister all the thoughts of that <b>love</b> to us: He has pledged Himself to such service.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#132:11">Page 132</a>   There is nothing the Lord cherishes in His heart more than to have His saints with Him; but before He has them with Him, He loves to be with them and to serve them in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#132:12">Page 132</a>   It is the peculiar and distinctive privilege of the present time: if there are suited conditions we can have His company, and the service of His <b>love</b> in this peculiarly blessed way.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#132:16">Page 132</a>   There is no greater privilege than to have the Lord with us to serve us in relation to all that which divine <b>love</b> has conceived and brought into effect.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#133:1">Page 133</a>   But for the moment I am thinking of how He loves to serve us in connection with all the thoughts of God, and in relation to the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#133:11">Page 133</a>  The position of the saints, according to divine thoughts, is a very wonderful one, whether it be in relation to the place where Christ has died, or to the <b>love</b> revealed in His death, or to the saints' place of association with Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#133:12">Page 133</a>   He loves to serve and support us in relation to it all, and to direct us into the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#133:13">Page 133</a>    He  is pledged to this service of <b>love</b>; are  we  surrendered to it?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#134:2">Page 134</a>   If the Lord does not give Himself to us in the freeness and gladness of His <b>love</b> and service, there is a moral reason, and we should be exercised and search our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#135:2">Page 135</a>   The church comes in to stand in heavenly relations to God and to Christ, but Israel will still have her own wonderful position and endowment, and will be held by the power of <b>love</b> and divine faithfulness in her appointed relationships.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#135:15">Page 135</a>   We have had the <b>love</b> side first, and now there is the hatred side.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#139:11">Page 139</a>   If the hearts of saints are encouraged and united together in <b>love</b>, there is nothing to hinder them from entering into "all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the full knowledge of the mystery of God; in which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge" ( Colossians 2:2 , 3)<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#146:3">Page 146</a>   In the meantime we see Him, and can sing of  "Our God whom we have known,  Well known in Jesus' <b>love</b>".<br>

<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#156:15">Page 156</a>   He has brought it back in a path of suffering <b>love</b>, but of complete devotedness, which ended in the offering up of Himself.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#164:11">Page 164</a>   The seraphim seem to be more identified with the divine nature; they ascribe holiness to God, and fly with the swiftness of divine <b>love</b> ( Isaiah 6 ).<br>

<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#191:16">Page 191</a>   Paul could say, "The <b>love</b> of Christ holds me"; he was consciously held in the embrace of that <b>love</b>; and in what a distinctive way did his devotedness become manifest<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#193:9">Page 193</a>   The soul must have as its very foundation a tenacious hold of the death of Christ as that in which the testimony of the righteousness and <b>love</b> of God are set forth.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#193:12">Page 193</a>   I need hardly remind any believer of how fully these two bases are set before us in  Romans 3  - 5 -- the righteousness and <b>love</b> of God made known in the way of redemption through the death of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#195:11">Page 195</a>   And we see how the wisdom of grace, and the special action of <b>love</b>, in appointing seven Hellenists to see to the matter, strengthened the corner<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#196:3">Page 196</a>   <b>Love</b> is spoken of as "the bond of perfectness"; it holds all together.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#198:12">Page 198</a>   In the case of the boards there are  two  bases under each, because on our side we need adequate testimony so that our faith may take firm hold of divine righteousness and <b>love</b> as revealed in the death of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#210:6">Page 210</a>   The way for saints to get into line with their brethren now is for each one to depart from iniquity and to "follow righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace", and to see that the heart is pure in relation to the Lord.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#215:14">Page 215</a>   The grace and <b>love</b> that come out in Him as Priest will abide in Him eternally; all that is moral and personal will be unchanged, but the priestly office will not be needed<br>

<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#225:2">Page 225</a>   It makes an immense difference when Christ is apprehended thus; it takes the mind and affections of those who <b>love</b> Him off the earth.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#227:12">Page 227</a>   In the affections of all who <b>love</b> Him there is desire to be personally fruitful, and to give a sound which will bear witness that He is living.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#227:15">Page 227</a>   The natural selfishness of the human heart was displaced by the energy of divine <b>love</b>.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#238:1">Page 238</a>  This leads on to the ram of consecration, which is typical of Christ in His devoted <b>love</b> as that which is to give character to the consecrated company, for its blood is put on the ear, thumb, and great toe of each one of them, and they have also to eat its flesh.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#240:3">Page 240</a>   How delightful it is to God to see Christ engaging the affections of a company that has true and divine thoughts of Him and His <b>love</b>!<br>

<a href="../cac/cac2.htm#241:6">Page 241</a>   That <b>love</b> is known today by the assembly, and it has become there the living spring of all that is pleasurable to God.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#2:7">Page 2</a>   Saints are taught of God to <b>love</b> one another, and if this divine teaching were not neutralized by human influences it would bring all christians together in every city, town, or village where they are found.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#2:11">Page 2</a>  If we think of our own times it is as saints have come together in <b>love</b> to one another as being of God's assembly that there have been communications of God's mind; great light has been given in regard to Christ and the assembly<br>

<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#6:15">Page 6</a>   In the light of One wholly devoted to God in obedience and <b>love</b> we discern how hateful lawlessness is, and how intense, searching and all-consuming is the judgment which has come upon sinful flesh.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#7:3">Page 7</a>   And then in Aaron's " sons " there may be a hint that it is our privilege to be with God in the relationship of sons for the satisfaction of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#8:5">Page 8</a>   No self-deception darkens the heart as we draw near, for we realize that holy <b>love</b> has taken its own way to judge and remove all that we were.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#8:6">Page 8</a>   We fully own what existed on our part, but the great and blessed fact that we engage our hearts with is that even that has brought to view in a glorious way the perfections and <b>love</b> of the Son of God.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#14:1">Page 14</a>   Everything in Him was found, even in that place of supreme testing, perfectly responsive to God in obedience, devotedness, and <b>love</b>, and though all was offered  to God  it was  for us .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#21:7">Page 21</a>   <b>Love</b> made Him a mourner in a world of woe, and the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in a form sympathetic with His sorrow, but as power that God might be made known in a world of human woe in the way of gentleness and grace and healing and deliverance.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#31:1">Page 31</a>   In approaching us God had nothing to say to us about anyone but Christ, and if we approach God what we say to Him in adoration and praise is the echo of what He has first said to us in grace and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#32:10">Page 32</a>  " He went into death according to God's will that He might open up to us an entirely new character of joy -- joy in God as revealed in infinite <b>love</b>.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#89:16">Page 89</a>   All those things which we can enjoy together as the people of God have reached us through death, and if two or any number of hearts are enjoying those things, and the holy <b>love</b> which gave them, they can thank God with one accord.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#92:10">Page 92</a>   The <b>love</b> of God comes out in this, that He would not have us to go on enjoying together indefinitely that which we have once taken up at the altar with Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#93:15">Page 93</a>   Many saints do not go beyond the "peace-offering of thanksgiving", but God contemplates His people being so affected by His grace and <b>love</b> that there will be purpose of heart to bring about dedication to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#95:13">Page 95</a>   The blood still retains all its blessed character and efficacy as having atoning value; it is a perfect covering for sin; but we know it also as bearing witness to all the blessing in the heart of God which has come to light through the revelation of God in the <b>love</b> of the new covenant.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#96:6">Page 96</a>   God would have us to hold in a very definite and personal way the apprehension of all that excellence in Christ which is His own peculiar portion and delight, but He would have us to hold it along with a precious sense of the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#96:7">Page 96</a>   The more definitely we hold the unfathomable depth and preciousness of what there is in Christ for God, the more shall we apprehend the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#97:8">Page 97</a>   The waving of the "breast" would mean that the <b>love</b> of Christ has been taken up by the saints in relation to all the pleasure that God has in it, and their affections move before God in the appreciation of it.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#97:11">Page 97</a>   It is a peculiar pleasure to God when the <b>love</b> of Christ is appreciated by the saints in relation to His delight in it.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#99:1">Page 99</a>   He ever walked in the blessed activity and service of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#99:2">Page 99</a>   How marvellous that He should become food for us that we might, in some small measure, <b>love</b> as He loved, and walk as He walked!<br>

<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#200:16">Page 200</a>   It is a question of the <b>love</b> of God, the value of the Sin-offering, and the preciousness of Christ to God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#204:4">Page 204</a>   We are the children of God down here, the subjects of His Fatherly care and <b>love</b>, His household; and we are sons in freedom in the very place where we were once slaves in bondage.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#204:6">Page 204</a>   Hence we are to be "imitators of God, as beloved children, and walk in <b>love</b>, even as the Christ loved us, and delivered himself up for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour" ( Ephesians 5:1 , 2).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#204:8">Page 204</a>   We are provisionally in the place where Israel was, and will be, but we are there in divine favour, and as knowing the <b>love</b> of God and of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#204:10">Page 204</a>   We perceive <b>love</b> that way, and as we know it we "walk in <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#207:12">Page 207</a>  "'Tis Jesus fills that holy place  Where glory dwells, and thy deep <b>love</b>  In its own fulness (known through grace)  Rests where He lives, in heaven above".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#208:10">Page 208</a>   Is it not that He "has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ; according as he has chosen us in him before the world's foundation, that we should be holy and blameless before him in <b>love</b>; having marked us out beforehand for sonship through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has taken us into favour in the Beloved: in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of offences, according to the riches of his grace"<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#210:8">Page 210</a>   We are to "withdraw from iniquity", to purify ourselves from vessels to dishonour in separating from them, and we are to "pursue righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart" ( 2 Timothy 2:19  - 22).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#213:8">Page 213</a>   Everything that truly belongs to the fellowship -- all that is of Christ; and that comes to us through His death, and the holy <b>love</b> of God revealed to us through death -- can be shared by all who <b>love</b> God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#213:11">Page 213</a>   We may enjoy together feeding upon Christ, with the happy consciousness that what we enjoy is the common portion of all who <b>love</b> God, and that we enjoy it as near to God, and in communion with His altar.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#214:13">Page 214</a>   So that it is a continual exercise not to take up anything for enjoyment that we do not hold in communion with God, and with those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#215:2">Page 215</a>   You are in "the rest" and "the inheritance" (verse 9), you <b>love</b> all saints, and you have "gates" in which you can enjoy what your soul desires.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#219:10">Page 219</a>   But if infinite <b>love</b> has considered the situation, and a Sinless One -- a Divine Person -- has come into flesh and blood that an unforfeited life of infinite value might be given in the way of atonement, what a revelation it is of what God is!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#219:17">Page 219</a>   It is in this way that we know the <b>love</b> and righteousness of a Saviour God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#221:4">Page 221</a>   The rich young man who came to the Lord was a natural man, but there were features in him which the Lord could value, and which drew out the Lord's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#225:11">Page 225</a>   Do you <b>love</b> to think of how perfectly God has secured rest for Himself in Christ?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#241:4">Page 241</a>   One spotless Lamb has borne the judgment due to the sinful man, and His <b>love</b> in doing it is now the food of the sheltered.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#241:5">Page 241</a>   All that I was as a fallen natural man was under judgment, but Christ has borne the judgment in <b>love</b>, and I feed on Him now so as to live by Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#246:11">Page 246</a>   He has prepared wonderful things for them that <b>love</b> Him, but they are not things which eye can see, or ear can hear, or which naturally come into man's heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#252:3">Page 252</a>   In contrast with all this, let us think much of the assembly as composed of all those who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and <b>love</b> Him, and as indwelt by the Spirit are in His life, and are really "first-fruits" to God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#253:6">Page 253</a>   Then we can get near to one another, and there are all the elements of a "holy convocation" in <b>love</b> and liberty, nothing "servile" about it; the saints by <b>love</b> serve one another.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#258:11">Page 258</a>   One of the greatest spiritual gains of recent times is the enlarged and deepened understanding of that precious death in its varied aspects, in its wondrous results for God and man, in its blessed import as bringing to an end the history of the man after the flesh, and giving full expression to the holy <b>love</b> of God, and also disclosing all the perfections of Christ in the fullest way, and revealing His <b>love</b> for the saints individually and for the assembly<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#261:2">Page 261</a>  In God's "great <b>love</b> wherewith he loved us (we too being dead in offences)", He "has quickened us with the Christ .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#261:6">Page 261</a>   The rapture is thus anticipated in spirit; the saints, quickened, elevated, and seated, have reached in spirit the  end  which divine <b>love</b> has purposed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#264:4">Page 264</a>   In presence of surrounding darkness spiritual light is to be maintained, and in presence of conditions which will culminate in open apostasy the reality of how God would retain His people before Him for His pleasure is to be maintained in faith and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#269:11">Page 269</a>   We can all be alike in "bowels of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, longsuffering", and in "<b>love</b> which is the bond of perfectness".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#271:6">Page 271</a>   They were to hold it as the gift of sovereign <b>love</b>, and to hold it in relation to the Giver; it was His inheritance ( Exodus 15:17 ), and they were "to him a people of inheritance" ( Deuteronomy 4:20 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#272:5">Page 272</a>  In the meantime the <b>love</b> of God has given to the partakers of the heavenly calling a wondrous inheritance in Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#272:6">Page 272</a>   But it can only be enjoyed with Him as we hold it in a sense of the <b>love</b> that has given it, and with reference to His will in the use we make of it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#272:8">Page 272</a>   What God has given us in Christ is the expression and witness of His <b>love</b>, and as we thus hold it we wish to take up the great gain of it in relation to His pleasure.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#272:10">Page 272</a>   We may be occupied with what "the land" is to us, and not hold it in relation to the <b>love</b> and pleasure of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#273:2">Page 273</a>    <b>Love</b>  gave the land, and <b>love</b> would have it to be held in relation to what was before God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#273:7">Page 273</a>   God would bring us under the influence of His <b>love</b> into sympathy with what He delights in.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#273:22">Page 273</a>   He has cherished all through the thought of that blessed time when He "will rest in his <b>love</b>" ( Zephaniah 3:17 )<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#274:1">Page 274</a>   He was ever saying, as it were, "My great thought is that you should share my rest, and enjoy my <b>love</b> in that rest".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#274:4">Page 274</a>   Nothing to do but to enjoy in restful obedience that which <b>love</b> had freely given!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#274:5">Page 274</a>  The great pleasure of God is that we should be restful, and enjoy what He has given us in His great <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#276:2">Page 276</a>   But God says, so to speak, "I will have the last word; I will not give up the thoughts of my <b>love</b>; every man shall return to his possession".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#276:11">Page 276</a>   It was set up in all the blessedness of the <b>love</b> of God, known by the Holy Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#276:14">Page 276</a>  A long history of failure has come in, but it has not changed God's thoughts, or the purposes of His <b>love</b>, and He will eventually bring His saints into all that He has purposed for them in Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#276:15">Page 276</a>   At the rapture He will place them all in the everlasting possession and enjoyment of what His <b>love</b> has given to them in Christ<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#277:4">Page 277</a>   It is delightful to think of the saints being actually introduced by divine power in an incorruptible condition into all that divine <b>love</b> has purposed for them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#281:3">Page 281</a>   A company has been called and secured for a place in heaven according to eternal counsels of <b>love</b> -- a company of many brethren predestinated to be conformed to the image of God's glorified Son, that He may be the Firstborn among them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#281:10">Page 281</a>   But there is a "fiftieth year", which suggests that the earth will also partake in the wondrous gain which will come to creation through the shining forth of that company of sons who are the fruit of the eternal purpose of God's <b>love</b>, and who have their place in heavenly glory outside God's ways with the earth<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#285:12">Page 285</a>   This speaks not of the original gift of divine <b>love</b>, but of the peculiar strength of that <b>love</b> in granting recovery and restoration when that gift has been departed from.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#286:12">Page 286</a>   The affections of the saints are being stirred up to hold the Head, and to <b>love</b> one another, and to reach after the possession and enjoyment of what is spiritual and heavenly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#288:15">Page 288</a>   When the trumpet of jubilee sounds the power of sovereign divine <b>love</b> will place the heirs in possession and enjoyment of the inheritance.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#290:10">Page 290</a>   He is taking account of every bit of response to His <b>love</b>, of desire to follow Christ, of purpose to walk in the Spirit, every manifestation of <b>love</b> to His people, every wish to contribute to their edification.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#290:18">Page 290</a>   Do we <b>love</b> to answer to the thoughts of God's heart, and value the opportunity of being restful with Him<br>
<a href="../cac/cac3.htm#294:2">Page 294</a>   It is an attractive subject to those who <b>love</b> God.<br>
<h3>Volume 4 - An Outline of the Book of Numbers</h3>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#4:10">Page 4</a>   God loves to take definite account of His people, and if we <b>love</b> Him as in the bond of the covenant we shall <b>love</b> to be taken account of by Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#6:11">Page 6</a>   2 Timothy goes on the ground that God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power, and of <b>love</b>, and of wise discretion.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#9:9">Page 9</a>   A pedigree that entitles us to be numbered for military service in relation to the testimony must make manifest that we are on the line of Christ as risen, and that we recognise nothing in man but what is the product of the working of God -- the outcome of His electing <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#42:3">Page 42</a>   And to this he added the exhortation, "For the rest, brethren, rejoice;  be perfected ; be encouraged; be of one mind; be at peace; and the God of <b>love</b> and peace shall be with you" ( 2 Corinthians 13:9  - 11).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#42:7">Page 42</a>   If we think of all that the saints are as of the assembly of God, the temple, the body, the anointed vessel of divine pleasure here, what incessant labour of <b>love</b> is called for that all this may be worked out in a practical way!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#42:9">Page 42</a>   The saints are to be perfected through service rendered to them, and through spiritual exercises promoted by that service, so that they may walk together in unity as knit together in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#49:4">Page 49</a>  The spirit of jealousy comes in when the rights of divine <b>love</b> have been owned, where a covenant has been entered into, but cause has been given to suspect that some corrupting influence is at work.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#53:5">Page 53</a>   The Spirit who indwells us ever witnesses to us the <b>love</b> of God expressed in the death of Christ, but He also witnesses that everything connected with us as in the flesh has been brought into the dust of death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#55:8">Page 55</a>   The testing in such cases may be humbling, as it was in regard of Simon, but it leads to increased dependence, and to our <b>love</b> for the Lord becoming apparent.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#56:14">Page 56</a>   When Paul writes with his own hand, "If any one <b>love</b> not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be Anathema Maranatha" ( 1 Corinthians 16:22 ), he is pronouncing the divine curse on unfaithfulness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#64:8">Page 64</a>   The very idea involves something distinctive which is an honour before God, and a deep inward satisfaction to the one who takes it up in <b>love</b> to Him, but which is different from the ordinary life of men.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#75:4">Page 75</a>   Men on earth will then be glad to enjoy their portion in relation to God, His <b>love</b> and favour will be their delight -- the new wine of His kingdom.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#75:5">Page 75</a>  But for us the "new wine" of that kingdom has already come in; it stands connected not with earthly things, but with the shining upon us of God's <b>love</b> and favour in Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#77:8">Page 77</a>   Blessed, kept, illuminated with divine <b>love</b> and favour, and now approved of God!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#80:13">Page 80</a>   Its service is not irksome to those who render it, for it is a labour of <b>love</b>, but it is "toil" ( 1 Corinthians 15:58 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#82:1">Page 82</a>  "Waggons" are accessory; they were not provided for in the original ordering, but were suggested by thoughtful <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#82:2">Page 82</a>   There is room in the divine economy for every suggestion of <b>love</b>; whatever <b>love</b> prompts will fit into the divine plan.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#82:6">Page 82</a>   I take it that a "waggon" might represent something that we could not precisely give chapter and verse for, but <b>love</b> suggests it; it facilitates the work of the Lord, and God accepts it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#82:7">Page 82</a>   In the service of the testimony there is room for the suggestiveness of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#82:8">Page 82</a>   Christianity is not a cut and dried system; it is a spiritual system, and leadership comes out in the ability to suggest in <b>love</b> what is suitable to be associated with it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#84:11">Page 84</a>   It is important to notice this; if any supposed offering of <b>love</b> set aside divine order, or practically became a substitute for spiritual power in ministry, we should know that it was altogether out of place<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#90:11">Page 90</a>   There are vessels to honour in the Christian profession, men who <b>love</b> the Lord and seek to honour Him, but alas!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#95:2">Page 95</a>   Here it is more in character like the sin-offering of the day of atonement -- sin dealt with for the glory of God as the basis of all that He does in sovereign <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#97:13">Page 97</a>   The other, which now comes before us, shows how provision has been made for Christ as the risen and glorified One being kept brightly in the view of those who <b>love</b> Him during the night of His rejection here, and while He is personally at the right hand of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#99:10">Page 99</a>   In the light of the type before us we see that it is the outcome of His <b>love</b> acting in a priestly way, and that it is the will of God that it should be so.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#101:9">Page 101</a>   It is by the appreciation of this great and wondrous fact that the Holy Spirit sheds the <b>love</b> of God abroad in our hearts at the very commencement of our spiritual life.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#106:7">Page 106</a>   God would have us to serve as those who can ever say in profound gladness of heart, "<b>Love</b>, that no suffering stayed  We'll praise, true <b>love</b> divine;  <b>Love</b> that for us atonement made,  <b>Love</b> that has made us Thine".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#114:8">Page 114</a>   Their cam was really of immense importance, and particularly for ourselves, for it brought out that God could provide for abnormal conditions amongst His people, and secure, even with reference to such conditions, what was due to Himself, and what the faith and <b>love</b> of His people desired.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#121:16">Page 121</a>   I do not say that we shall cease to be the subjects of His <b>love</b> and faithful care, but we shall not be moving  with Him .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#128:8">Page 128</a>   The first movement is with those who are nearest to the sunrising, representing those who <b>love</b> His appearing, and look in the most distinct way for His coming.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#134:13">Page 134</a>   Christ, as the Witness and Pledge of divine <b>love</b> and faithfulness, goes before His flock as their Leader and Shepherd, charging Himself with care that they shall have a resting place even in the wilderness!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#134:18">Page 134</a>   But "the ark of the covenant of Jehovah" speaks of Christ in the blessed service of His <b>love</b>, leading in every wilderness movement, and ever having in mind "a resting place".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#134:19">Page 134</a>   It is by His own leading that His saints are brought together in assembly, to rest there in the <b>love</b> of which His supper speaks, to know the covenant <b>love</b> of God, and the place which we have before Him as sons<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#135:14">Page 135</a>   He loves to rest in the midst of the holy myriads who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#138:12">Page 138</a>   He has caused His fire to abate, and has brought in again and again the evidence of His compassion, and of His thoughts of faithful <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#140:13">Page 140</a>   Obedience, subjection, dependence, meekness, lowliness, the <b>love</b> of righteousness, the hatred of lawlessness, absolute separation from the world as not being of it, delight in the saints, having His portion in God, setting God continually before Him<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#145:4">Page 145</a>   God's thought has ever been to express Himself in Man, and thus to draw men to Himself; "I drew them with bands of a man, with cords of <b>love</b>" ( Hosea 11:4 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#160:3">Page 160</a>   If God brings His people into contact with what His heart would delight to give them it finds out how far God Himself, as known in <b>love</b>, has His place before us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#161:3">Page 161</a>   All that is the wondrous outcome of the riches of God's mercy, and because of His great <b>love</b> wherewith He loved us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#161:6">Page 161</a>   It is a comfort to see that before the twelve men went to search out the land God had distinctly in view that He would bring His people in, not on the ground of anything there might be, or might not be, in the flesh, but by means of Christ, and by His own sovereign <b>love</b>, and His mercy and grace.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#161:8">Page 161</a>   And this is suggested to us as the standpoint from which God contemplated the effectuation of the purpose of His <b>love</b> before the testing of the flesh in relation to it took place.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#162:2">Page 162</a>  But then, in the ways of God, He does test and expose the flesh, and the supreme test is by bringing it into contact with that which divine <b>love</b> proposes to give.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#162:9">Page 162</a>   He will come in for everyone who turns to Him, and give impulse to the soul to go in for all that is spiritually available through His gift of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#163:5">Page 163</a>   Are we saying that what God gives at the present time is the very best that <b>love</b> can give, and that it is in our hearts, and that we are set to go in for it, having confidence in God that He will bring us into it?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#163:11">Page 163</a>   It is the choicest possible portion for men, for it is that which the <b>love</b> of God proposes to give; it must therefore surpass every other gain, and transcend the highest thoughts of men.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#163:16">Page 163</a>   If God proposes in His <b>love</b> to give a "land" to those in whom He delights, faith would never think of enquiring "whether it is good or bad"<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#165:9">Page 165</a>   "The whole body, fitted together, and connected by every joint of supply, according to the working in its measure of each one part, works for itself the increase of the body to its self-building up in <b>love</b>" ( Ephesians 4:16 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#166:8">Page 166</a>   It speaks of "God's wisdom in a mystery, that hidden wisdom which God had pre-determined before the ages for our glory: which none of the princes of this age knew, (for had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory;) but according as it is written, Things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that <b>love</b> him, but God has revealed to us by his Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#172:1">Page 172</a>   The door is held open by infinite mercy to give us still an opportunity to judge our natural unbelief, and to hearken to the word of God which is speaking still of all that His <b>love</b> has to give.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#172:13">Page 172</a>  Christ as the true Moses -- the Mediator -- has brought to men the declaration of God in grace and <b>love</b>, the disclosure of all His favourableness, so that men may be blessed in the knowledge of God, and may have an inheritance according to His thoughts of <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#175:3">Page 175</a>   They may be conscious that they are not in possession or enjoyment of "the land", but they know that it is "a very, very good land", because the God whose <b>love</b> they know is the Giver of it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#181:9">Page 181</a>   The generation of faith alone will go into what God has purposed in <b>love</b> for His people.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#182:6">Page 182</a>   Not one of the generation of unbelief will come into the things which God has prepared for those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#184:7">Page 184</a>   The trials and difficulties of the wilderness now become discipline for us which faith accepts as the chastening of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#184:13">Page 184</a>   But in that epistle, though the writer warns against the danger and possibility of unbelief working, he writes as persuaded concerning those to whom he wrote that they had shown <b>love</b> to God's Name.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#189:3">Page 189</a>   If such was the joy of the servant it gives a wonderful impression of the joy of Christ in being poured out in the service of God, and in <b>love</b> to the saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#189:6">Page 189</a>   He was poured out in the sanctuary, in <b>love</b> to the Father, and in doing the Father's commandment.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#192:2">Page 192</a>   There was everything in Christ which was beautiful and perfect in God's sight, and in <b>love</b> He gave it up to go into death, but He has received it all back in a new way in the risen One.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#202:13">Page 202</a>   We shall have no power to follow righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace, save as we call on the Lord out of a pure heart<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#228:12">Page 228</a>   In His <b>love</b>, and in the value of the redemption which He has accomplished, He has made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father ( Revelation 1:5 ,6)<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#230:16">Page 230</a>   Departure from first <b>love</b>, worldliness, evil doctrine, the woman Jezebel permitted to teach, a name to live but still being dead, unwatchfulness, lukewarmness, boastfulness along with extreme spiritual poverty, is all very grievous under the priestly eye of Christ<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#235:4">Page 235</a>  While as yet the first tabernacle had its standing, and, indeed, even so long as Christ was here in flesh, the purpose of God's <b>love</b> was, so to speak, hidden behind the veil.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#236:1">Page 236</a>   The purpose and calling of God are set forth in Him as Man before God, and He is Priest to bring the influence of it to bear on the whole house of God, to make the thoughts of divine <b>love</b> dominant there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#237:6">Page 237</a>   Such approach will have a transforming effect, displacing human thoughts, and bringing the holy priesthood in heart and mind into correspondence with the great thoughts of divine <b>love</b>, so that the service of God in the assembly can be intelligently taken up.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#241:1">Page 241</a>   It is a beautiful intimation of what God would bring to pass as the end of His ways in the pure sovereignty of His mercy and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#241:8">Page 241</a>   He is bringing His people to know His covenant <b>love</b>, as witnessed in the death of Christ, with the result that they are so enriched, and their hearts so moved in appreciation of Christ, that they bring copious and varied offerings.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#242:7">Page 242</a>   All this would teach us that any lack of priestly vigour could be traced to lack of spiritual offerings, and the absence of these would indicate that the people of God have not had their hearts much directed into the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#243:11">Page 243</a>   We have all something which can be devoted, if our affections move Godward in response to His <b>love</b>, and one feels persuaded that we should be stimulated to much more devotedness if we realised what a gain it would bring to the priestly service of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#256:17">Page 256</a>   The offender at Corinth had evidently manifested repentance before the Apostle exhorted the saints to show grace to him, and assure him of their <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#262:2">Page 262</a>   And the washing shows that something of a sanctifying and cleansing character goes on even in one who serves in <b>love</b> his brother who has sinned.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#264:14">Page 264</a>  I have no doubt the divine thought was that the people should <b>love</b> the priest as the one who bore their names as a memorial before Jehovah.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#265:8">Page 265</a>   If we <b>love</b> God we shall <b>love</b> the Priest, for He represents all that is in God's purpose for us, and He represents us as called according to purpose.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#270:2">Page 270</a>   It is said further, "Who shall separate us from the <b>love</b> of Christ?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#270:6">Page 270</a>   The <b>love</b> of Christ here spoken of is undoubtedly His <b>love</b> as Priest.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#271:6">Page 271</a>   It would have its answer in the apostle's enquiry, "Who shall separate us from the <b>love</b> of Christ?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#271:8">Page 271</a>   Such things  do  bring out what we are, but they do not separate from the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#271:11">Page 271</a>   There was to be, typically, the assurance that refreshing streams would flow forth from Christ, the blessed witness that no evils that can befall, no creature power in the universe, can separate God's elect from the <b>love</b> of Christ, or from the <b>love</b> of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#271:16">Page 271</a>   The rock here is a "high rock"; it is typical of Christ exalted -- who "has been also raised up; who is also at the right hand of God" -- and as the One whose <b>love</b> yields such refreshing that we more than conquer in the "evil place"<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#272:3">Page 272</a>   Being able to  speak  to the Rock indicates that we have an intelligent apprehension of what is in Christ as the One in whom God's purpose of <b>love</b> stands firm.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#274:5">Page 274</a>   No divine or dispensational ordering that could stand in relation to us as in the flesh could possibly bring us into that which God has purposed for us in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#274:10">Page 274</a>   It is a Priest after that order who alone can bring the people of God into that which His <b>love</b> has purposed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#274:13">Page 274</a>   It has passed to One who ever liveth, and who holds His priesthood in relation to us, not as in the flesh, but as God's elect and called people, and therefore in connection with all that is in God's purpose of <b>love</b> for us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#275:11">Page 275</a>   And how unworthy an object of pursuit, if compared with the wondrous thoughts and gifts of divine <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#275:14">Page 275</a>   To have the enjoyment of what is ours according to divine <b>love</b> and purpose is far more important and precious than to gain the whole world.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#277:11">Page 277</a>  The truth is that God could not bring us into what His <b>love</b> proposes to give us without teaching us a profound fundamental lesson.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#277:19">Page 277</a>   Every bit of unbelief, rebellion, murmuring, every despising of what God would give in <b>love</b>, the distaste for Christ as God's great provision for men, can only be understood or estimated aright when we see that all had its origin in the serpent<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#278:1">Page 278</a>   God is bent on our being brought to judge the very root of the mischief, for it is only thus that we can appreciate the great action of His <b>love</b> for us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#279:13">Page 279</a>   His <b>love</b> is known by the supreme sacrifice which He made that men might be freed from all that came in by the serpent.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#280:2">Page 280</a>   In the type the serpent was lifted up in the fortieth year of the wilderness, but the <b>love</b> of God has now made it possible for us to begin with it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#280:3">Page 280</a>   God, acting in <b>love</b> for His sinful creature man, has cleared the ground effectually, to His own satisfaction and glory, so that nothing now stands in the way of what His <b>love</b> proposes.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#280:6">Page 280</a>   The great thoughts of divine <b>love</b> can take effect, for, on the divine side, the flesh is no longer there to obstruct them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#281:2">Page 281</a>   God's <b>love</b> has not in view for men merely a better kind of life for this world, but a life of a totally different kind and order from anything that man knows naturally -- a life altogether outside the range of death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#281:4">Page 281</a>   Life is not in the man that is here, for he has to look to Another to get it, but the One to whom he looks has been given in death as the great witness of the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#281:6">Page 281</a>   It is of the utmost importance to see that the sphere into which He entered as risen from among the dead is the sphere of that life which the <b>love</b> of God has in view for men.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#281:9">Page 281</a>   But it means that we consciously appreciate and enjoy the <b>love</b> of God, and the spiritual conditions which that <b>love</b> has established, into which we enter as believing on the One who has been lifted up.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#282:1">Page 282</a>   It was, we might say, the great proposal of divine <b>love</b>, that God has loved men in view of eternal life.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#283:10">Page 283</a>   It typifies the great change which is brought about when believers begin to consider Christ as the One in whom God has put the light of His great proposals of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#283:13">Page 283</a>   And it is a wondrous new day in the soul's history when Christ becomes to it the light of all that is in God's <b>love</b> and purpose.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#285:4">Page 285</a>   It is God's proposal in His own free and sovereign <b>love</b>, and it brings out in a wonderful way what God would have to mark His people subjectively.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#289:13">Page 289</a>   Who shall separate us from the <b>love</b> of Christ?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#290:6">Page 290</a>   So that the <b>love</b> of God was free to have its own way, and He could say, "They are blessed".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#290:10">Page 290</a>   All this is the outcome of sovereign <b>love</b> on God's part, according to which He has worked in His people.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#290:11">Page 290</a>   It is impossible for Him to curse, or to allow to be cursed, what He has Himself wrought in the sovereignty of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#291:1">Page 291</a>   God's people cannot be cursed because they are the subjects of His work, according to His electing <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#293:11">Page 293</a>   God works in His sovereign <b>love</b> to bring this about.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#293:12">Page 293</a>   Balaam's parables are of great importance as bringing out what God is doing in His great <b>love</b> and power.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#295:1">Page 295</a>   It is important that we should understand that we are not saints merely because at a certain time we decided for Christ, or believed on Him, but because God has called us in sovereign <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#296:4">Page 296</a>   Every Link in the chain is absolutely unbreakable; its strength lies in God, and in His purpose of sovereign <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#301:14">Page 301</a>   And gifts are to be exercised in the spirit of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#302:8">Page 302</a>   That epistle, if taken up in genuine exercise, would produce a self-judged and separate people, amongst whom the Spirit could act without restraint, and where <b>love</b> would be followed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#307:3">Page 307</a>   There is a rule set up in heaven in the Lord Jesus Christ, and though it is in mystery -- that is, only known to those initiated into it -- it is exercising sway over the thousands of them that <b>love</b> God and keep His commandments.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#309:8">Page 309</a>   Jesus as the bright morning star is in the hearts of His saints, so that all that He will be as in glorious ascendency when He comes is already here in the affections and testimony of those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#313:8">Page 313</a>   It is not to little children, but to young men -- who are strong, and who have the word of God abiding in them, and who have overcome the wicked one -- that the warning is addressed, "<b>Love</b> not the world, nor the things in the world" ( 1 John 2:15 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#314:3">Page 314</a>   Let us ask ourselves honestly, Are the things to which we are turning likely to increase our delight and liberty in private prayer, our <b>love</b> for the Scriptures, our pleasure in the company of spiritual persons, or our habitual experience of nearness to God?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#315:12">Page 315</a>   For the Lord said, "If ye were of the world, the world would <b>love</b> its own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on account of this the world hates you"<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#317:15">Page 317</a>   Faithfulness to God in judging what is displeasing to Him is the truest <b>love</b> and benefit to all His people.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#320:2">Page 320</a>   If Christian fellowship is to be taken up in a divine way in the present condition of things it can only be as we "pursue righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart" ( 2 Timothy 2:22 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#321:7">Page 321</a>   I have no doubt that God is more interested in the inheritance which His <b>love</b> would have us to enjoy than He is in the forgiveness, essential as the latter is, if we are to have any happy relations with Him at all.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#322:7">Page 322</a>   The discovery of what the flesh is, the learning of God's faithful and forbearing <b>love</b>, the grace of priesthood, seeing how sin in the flesh has been condemned, giving place to the Spirit as the springing Well, are all designed of God to lead to the development of a family character of things amongst His people.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#322:10">Page 322</a>  John's first epistle views the saints in family character -- children of God, walking together in <b>love</b> as brethren.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#324:2">Page 324</a>   Paul had no need to write to them concerning brotherly <b>love</b>; he says, "ye yourselves are taught of God to <b>love</b> one another.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#324:5">Page 324</a>   Paul had heard of the brethren in Colosse and at Ephesus that they had <b>love</b> towards all the saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#329:12">Page 329</a>   They followed Jehovah fully in the thoughts of His <b>love</b> for His people<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#333:1">Page 333</a>   Such are to be recognised, according to Paul's word, "But we beg you brethren, to know those who labour among you, and take the lead among you in the Lord, and admonish you, and to regard them exceedingly in <b>love</b> on account of their work" ( 1 Thessalonians 5:12 ,13).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#333:7">Page 333</a>  CHAPTER 28 The <b>love</b> of God has provided in Christ a wonderful inheritance for His people, but this chapter and the next unfold what is due to God from those who enjoy the inheritance.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#334:3">Page 334</a>   His people who <b>love</b> Him gladly render the service in liberty, but it is, nevertheless, a matter of command which is not to be disregarded or disobeyed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#342:9">Page 342</a>   And every lover of Christ knows how the loaf and the cup speak of the <b>love</b> in which the Lord Jesus has been into death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#343:2">Page 343</a>   His righteousness and holiness are known through the death of Christ in the whole moral universe, while the glory of His <b>love</b> shines transcendent.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#344:1">Page 344</a>   On this ground the holy priesthood can still carry on the service of God, notwithstanding all that has taken place, and that service largely consists in speaking to Him of what His beloved Son has accomplished, and of all that His <b>love</b> has brought to pass, and will bring to pass, on the ground of the death of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#344:6">Page 344</a>   All that the loaf and the cup speak of is  for us , but what a portion God has in it -- His will established, His <b>love</b> expressed, and both in such a way that men are brought into the divine value of these great realities!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#347:14">Page 347</a>   But this is already true in the purely spiritual associations of "the eighth day", for the saints as having their part by God's election, and by His work, in that eternal day are holy and without blame in <b>love</b>; they arc in sonship for God's delight, taken into favour in the Beloved; they are blessed according to eternal purpose.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#348:4">Page 348</a>   We have been considering in the two previous chapters certain things which were obligatory in the service of God, but we come now to movements which are the spontaneous fruit of His grace and <b>love</b> being known in the hearts of His people.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#348:5">Page 348</a>   They are what we sing of sometimes as "the answering chord to <b>love</b> so rich and free".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#349:11">Page 349</a>   "But if the bondman shall say distinctly, I <b>love</b> my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go free" ( Exodus 21:6 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#349:12">Page 349</a>   This was no obligation imposed on Him, but it was a bond taken up in the liberty of <b>love</b>, by which He bound Himself, and to which He is held.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#349:13">Page 349</a>   And we may be assured that He is fully equal to everything that He has undertaken, both in <b>love</b> and in capability, so that it is impossible that any part of it should fail of accomplishment<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#350:2">Page 350</a>  All that Ho undertook in His <b>love</b> to the Father He has brought to completion.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#350:4">Page 350</a>   All is viewed in  Ephesians 5  as effected by Himself in the devotion of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#352:10">Page 352</a>   The assembly in Ephesus had left her first <b>love</b>; she had got away in heart from her Husband; and if not quite in the place of a "widow" she was on the way to it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#352:11">Page 352</a>   What He spoke of in  Revelation 2:2 ,3 was, no doubt, somewhat on the line of a "vow", but it had so little value in His sight now that she had left her first <b>love</b> that if He came to her as unrepentant it could only be to remove her lamp out of its place.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#353:11">Page 353</a>   "For the <b>love</b> of the Christ constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died; and he died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised" ( 2 Corinthians 5:14 , 15).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#365:10">Page 365</a>   How blessed to be covered under the eye of God with all that in which the glory of His <b>love</b> is set forth!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#369:8">Page 369</a>   Even the providential goodness of God may become a hindrance to us spiritually if we settle down in it, and do not go on to possess and enjoy what His <b>love</b> has specially in view for us at the present time.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#370:1">Page 370</a>   But if He has something before Him for Us which is far greater and more precious, and we are detained from entering upon what His <b>love</b> would delight to bring Us into by these good things on the earth it is indeed a serious matter.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#372:7">Page 372</a>  Reuben and Gad definitely took ground as to their place and blessing which came short of what Jehovah in His <b>love</b> had purposed for them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#374:9">Page 374</a>   If we take lower ground than that which His <b>love</b> proposes we should take He may allow us to occupy it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#374:13">Page 374</a>   What could be more lamentable than to have to reflect, perhaps on a death-bed, that we have not appreciated, or taken up in spiritual power, the wondrous portion which the <b>love</b> of God would have delighted to bring us into.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#376:7">Page 376</a>   He had referred in the first year of their journeyings to "thousands of them that <b>love</b> me".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#379:5">Page 379</a>   There will be the consciousness of increasing freedom from what narrows and clouds the true knowledge of God, and of getting nearer to all that is in the purpose of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#383:11">Page 383</a>   Now it becomes the exercise of faith and <b>love</b> to dispossess in a practical way all those darkening powers, so that the whole realm where they have dwelt and ruled may be held, not only for God, but for the joy and full blessing of the creature.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#384:2">Page 384</a>   God may be known in light and <b>love</b> exactly in all those particulars as to which Satan has sought to darken men spiritually, and this blessed knowledge of God enriches men, and makes them divinely happy, so that they pass in spirit outside the range of sin and death, and possess life eternal in Christ as a matter of conscious enjoyment.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#386:8">Page 386</a>   The saints are thus set together for the collective enjoyment of the portion which divine <b>love</b> has allotted to them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#386:10">Page 386</a>   <b>Love</b> wants all the brethren, and delights to have as many of them as possible, for the practical enjoyment together of the God-given portion in Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#386:12">Page 386</a>   But then, as all are "joint-heirs", there is a common participation; that is, I believe, the idea of fellowship as John presents it -- a common enjoyment in family affections of what divine <b>love</b> has made ours.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#389:2">Page 389</a>   The portion of the saints is filled with the pure and holy light of God revealed in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#389:6">Page 389</a>   He is seen to be the Son of the Father's <b>love</b>, the One in whom we have redemption, and His greatness and glory shine out transcendently.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#402:5">Page 402</a>   He has called upon His people to "withdraw from iniquity"; He has bid them purify themselves from vessels to dishonour in separating from them; He has enjoined them to "pursue righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace, with them that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart", (see  2 Timothy 2:19  - 22).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#403:8">Page 403</a>   I suppose that the teaching of Paul and John never came so widely before the saints as it has within the last hundred years, and this has been by actings of pure mercy, that exercised hearts might be drawn to what is most precious and elevated, and might enjoy together the thoughts of divine <b>love</b> that have been so long departed from.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#403:13">Page 403</a>   There must be no relaxation of the principle of separation; no faltering in the pursuit of righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace; no weakening of pure heart dependence; no want of loyalty to the bond in which we walk with our like-minded brethren<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#405:7">Page 405</a>   Admitting all the weakness on our side, we can still say, "See what <b>love</b> the Father has given to us, that we should be called the children of God" ( 1 John 3:1 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#405:8">Page 405</a>   "Those who <b>love</b> God" ( Romans 8:28 ;  1 Corinthians 2:9 ) are not only heirs in title, but they have a nature suited to inherit what divine <b>love</b> has prepared for them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#407:3">Page 407</a>   God intended His people to be together in their various localities, as walking practically in the fellowship to which He had called them, so that they might enjoy together the inheritance which His <b>love</b> has bestowed upon them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#408:7">Page 408</a>   The distinctions of gifts, and of services, and of operations are designed of God to make known and to retain in the affections of the saints what He has given to them in <b>love</b> as a present inheritance, But these spiritual activities cannot possibly minister to what is sectarian because they come out in many members who form one body, and each local company of saints to be according to the truth, and to provide for the members functioning as God intended, must have "body" character.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac4.htm#410:3">Page 410</a>   It is our part to recognise what God has given in sovereign <b>love</b>, and the spiritual endowments which He has conferred upon the assembly that it might stand in the good of the inheritance.<br>
<h3>Volume 5 - An Outline of the Book of Deuteronomy</h3>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#2:2">Page 2</a>   What answers to it for us is that God has made known the purpose of His <b>love</b> to give us a wondrous inheritance in Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#2:4">Page 2</a>   Our first consciousness of the <b>love</b> of God is when that <b>love</b> is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit ( Romans 5:8 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#2:5">Page 2</a>   But God's object in shedding abroad His <b>love</b> in our hearts is that we may <b>love</b> Him, and if we <b>love</b> Him we shall be interested in the things which He has prepared for them that <b>love</b> Him, and those things are the inheritance.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#2:7">Page 2</a>   The <b>love</b> of God would bless His people infinitely, and in a way worthy of Himself, but man is marked naturally by unbelief, and its workings appear even in those who are the subjects of God's mercy and grace.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#3:6">Page 3</a>   As knowing His <b>love</b> we come under His instruction.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#4:1">Page 4</a>   The people of God are viewed all through this book as loved by Him -- "Yea, he loveth the peoples" (chapter 33: 3) -- but it is <b>love</b> that acts governmentally according to the fidelity or the unfaithfulness of those loved.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#4:3">Page 4</a>  We shall find in this book -- if helped of God to do so -- much instruction as to the inheritance, and the conditions on which we can enjoy all that the <b>love</b> of God proposes to bring us into.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#4:8">Page 4</a>  But; what is peculiarly precious in Deuteronomy is that all these things are presented as being learned under the personal instruction of Christ -- the blessed One who loves us, and who knows perfectly all the thoughts of divine <b>love</b> in regard to us, and who delights to impart those thoughts to us<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#5:1">Page 5</a>   The consideration of this must, surely, awaken the most lively interest in this book on the part of all those who <b>love</b> God, and who <b>love</b> the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#5:13">Page 5</a>   The secret of long delay as to the possession and enjoyment of the inheritance lies in the fact that the <b>love</b> of God, as known in the glad tidings, does not really govern our affections<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#6:1">Page 6</a>   This leaves room for the workings of unbelief, which disclose the true character of what we are naturally, even in presence of the most blessed actings of God in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#6:5">Page 6</a>   We have not kept in view the blessed proposals of the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#7:1">Page 7</a>   Such things shew how little we are really governed either by the <b>love</b> of God or by the prospect of the inheritance.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#8:13">Page 8</a>  " A heart governed by the <b>love</b> of God could afford to pass by many personal wrongs.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#9:2">Page 9</a>   But how many things would silently drop if <b>love</b> worked in the heart!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#9:16">Page 9</a>   This is the answer to the "tribulations" of  Romans 5:3 , endured in the consciousness of the <b>love</b> of God, and intensifying hope that does not make ashamed<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#10:2">Page 10</a>   "And not only that, but we also boast in tribulations, knowing that tribulation works endurance; and endurance, experience; and experience, hope; and hope does not make ashamed, because the <b>love</b> of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which has been given to us" ( Romans 5:3  - 5).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#12:1">Page 12</a>   They bad proved the paternal <b>love</b> of God in all the way, but they believed Him not.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#14:11">Page 14</a>   Then if I see some manifestation of the flesh in a brother or sister do I always remember that in precious and holy <b>love</b> Christ bore the full weight of what is due to it?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#14:14">Page 14</a>   The flesh has to be condemned; it is impossible that it should be tolerated; but let us judge it in the light of the way in which divine <b>love</b> has dealt with it in the sufferings and death of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#19:2">Page 19</a>  This is very instructive as shewing the kind of spirit God would have in His people whom He is preparing to enter into the full thought which is in the purpose of His <b>love</b> for them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#21:11">Page 21</a>   But if it speaks, as it surely does, of the <b>love</b> of the Lord's people, and of their practical care for His interests, it is not an inferior item  to Him .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#23:2">Page 23</a>   Such victories are a great and divine encouragement to move forward into that spiritual territory which lies on the other side of Jordan -- the sphere which God's <b>love</b> and purpose have ever in view as the proper inheritance of His people.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#25:9">Page 25</a>   It is the purpose of His <b>love</b> to give us that land for our possession and enjoyment, and it is a very serious matter to stop short of it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#26:2">Page 26</a>   How  He  cherished every precious thought of the <b>love</b> of God!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#27:3">Page 27</a>   But His own death was a necessity ever present to His thoughts -- the Jordan was between Him and the fruition of all the precious and holy purposes of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#27:10">Page 27</a>   In the Gospels we see the whole of the "good land" as in the view of Christ -- the kingdom of the heavens, the kingdom of God, the presence of the Holy Spirit the Comforter, eternal life, the assembly, the full blessing of men according to the thought and purpose of divine <b>love</b> -- but for it to be entered upon by the people of God Moses must be succeeded by Joshua.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#29:7">Page 29</a>   It is only those who <b>love</b> God who can truly take up His "statutes and ordinances"; all must move on the principle of "If ye <b>love</b> me keep my commandments" ( John 14:15 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#30:12">Page 30</a>   If we <b>love</b> Him it will be a matter of deep interest to us to know it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#31:5">Page 31</a>   The pleasure of divine <b>love</b> concerning us is truly wonderful; but in order to take it up rightly we must never forget how God has spoken to us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#32:6">Page 32</a>   It was, even literally, as presented here, a speaking of favour and <b>love</b> to a people chosen of God and redeemed by Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#32:7">Page 32</a>  The remarkable expression, "burned with fire to the heart of heaven" -- an expression not found in Exodus -- has, I do not doubt, a typical reference to the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#32:8">Page 32</a>   It speaks of the unquenchable flame of that holy <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#32:10">Page 32</a>   The fire intimates, indeed, the consuming of all that is unsuitable to God; it is a sin consuming flame; but from the midst of it God speaks in <b>love</b> to His chosen people.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#32:12">Page 32</a>   Man in the flesh could never apprehend the blessedness of the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#32:14">Page 32</a>   Apart from it, all will be cloudy, dark, and obscure in the heart of man, however blessedly God may speak in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#33:1">Page 33</a>  " But it was by the action of the <b>love</b> of God that He was there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#33:3">Page 33</a>   That is a fire that burns "to the heart of heaven" -- the unquenchable flame of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#33:5">Page 33</a>   How wondrous that God should reveal Himself from heaven, by sending His own Son to bear the judgment of sin, consuming all that was abhorrent to Him, but in that very time and place making Himself known in <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#33:6">Page 33</a>   We have to do now with a <b>love</b> which reaches the very "heart of heaven".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#33:7">Page 33</a>   God will burn up all that is unsuitable to Himself, but He will declare His <b>love</b> in the way of covenant, and secure thereby a people for Himself -- "a people of inheritance, as it is this day" (verse 20).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#33:8">Page 33</a>  Luke 15  makes known a <b>love</b> which meets the lost and the sinful, but which burns -- I think we may say -- to the heart of heaven.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#33:11">Page 33</a>   Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant is now in "the heart of heaven", and all the <b>love</b> of God disclosed in His dying for sinful men is being uttered from the heaven of His glory.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#33:12">Page 33</a>   Sin has been unsparingly judged, but in the way of <b>love</b> to man, for God's "own Son" has borne the judgment, and is the eternal Witness of the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#33:13">Page 33</a>  If we understood how God has spoken to us "from the midst of the fire" we should understand better the chastening of His <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#34:6">Page 34</a>   God spoke to us in <b>love</b> through the death of His Son, and gave us His Spirit to pour out that <b>love</b> into our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#34:10">Page 34</a>   The Lord would ever direct our hearts into the <b>love</b> of God; He would have us to drink into it afresh each time that we drink the cup of the Lord's supper.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#34:13">Page 34</a>   The knowledge of God made known in <b>love</b> introduces an entirely new character and measure of creature responsibility.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#34:14">Page 34</a>   Our walk, our words, our spirits must now be worthy of Him whose <b>love</b> we know.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#34:17">Page 34</a>   But the blessed God has come out in the revelation of Himself to bind us to Him as known in <b>love</b>, and He says, Now what you know Me to be is to govern you in everything; as My people you are to be worthy of Me<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#35:19">Page 35</a>  There is no demand now upon man in the flesh, There is a speaking in <b>love</b> on God's part, and a divine working in men so that they appreciate what has been spoken.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#36:6">Page 36</a>   Christ would ever remind us that we are to walk together as brethren, and to go in to possess the "good land", in the light of how God has spoken to us from heaven -- a speaking of infinite grace and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#39:6">Page 39</a>   It involves restoration to the "land" of His <b>love</b> and purpose in Christ Jesus.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#40:2">Page 40</a>   It is wholly on the principle of sovereign mercy, and in the exercise of His own <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#40:3">Page 40</a>   From the beginning to the end of His ways all is that we might know Him ( Deuteronomy 4:35 ) as acting in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#40:18">Page 40</a>   To be restored from forgetfulness and idolatry is great mercy, but what can be said of the deservings of those who slay the One who has been so truly a Neighbour, and who is the supreme object of God's <b>love</b> and delight?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#43:9">Page 43</a>   It is not left to us to determine the conditions of the covenant, we have simply to fall in with what God has ordained, and those who <b>love</b> Him are delighted that it should be so.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#46:10">Page 46</a>   All that God is in grace and <b>love</b> is told out in a Man; the glory of God is in the face of Jesus; the glory of the Christ is that He is the Image of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#48:7">Page 48</a>  There is no command to <b>love</b> God in the "ten words", (though there is in verse 5 of the next chapter) but there is an intimation that He has "thousands" who do so.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#48:15">Page 48</a>   But His children are, characteristically, "those who <b>love</b> God" ( Romans 8:28 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#50:7">Page 50</a>   Jealousy supposes a definite engagement or committal; it supposes that we have known the <b>love</b> of God, and recognised that He is entitled to our affections, and we have given them to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#50:8">Page 50</a>   Jehovah could say seven hundred years afterwards, "I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the <b>love</b> of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness" ( Jeremiah 2:2 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#50:12">Page 50</a>   If "<b>love</b> is strong as death" it has its counterpart in a jealousy which is "cruel as Sheol: the flashes thereof are flashes of fire, flames of Jah" ( Song of Songs 8:6 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#50:13">Page 50</a>   It speaks of the intensity of divine <b>love</b>; God cannot bear not to have the responsive affections of His people.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#50:14">Page 50</a>   Human jealousy has all kinds of mixed feelings and motives in it, but the jealousy of God is the jealousy of an unquenchable <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#50:16">Page 50</a>   That supper speaks sweetly and touchingly of His <b>love</b>, but if we come to the supper in an unjudged state we must expect that the fire of jealousy will burn.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#51:4">Page 51</a>   Has He not won our <b>love</b>?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#51:5">Page 51</a>   What a solemn thing if, after the <b>love</b> of espousals has had its place, there should come a time when God has to say, I remember when your heart was on fire towards me, but it is cold today!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#51:10">Page 51</a>   We shall then come in for the "mercy" which is shewn to the "thousands of them that <b>love</b> me and keep my commandments".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#52:13">Page 52</a>   God has used both father and mother as expressive of His own parental <b>love</b>, and He would set up what corresponds with His own care in every Christian household, "The household of God" is where His parental care is known, and every Christian household should be expressive of features which characterise God's household<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#55:1">Page 55</a>   Parental interest and care amongst the people of God is the direct product of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#59:5">Page 59</a>   Infinite <b>love</b> is there indeed, but infinite holiness too, and it is not well that the sense of this should be feeble in our souls.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#59:7">Page 59</a>   He would have us to fear Him; it is most wholesome to do so; there could be no true knowledge of His <b>love</b> otherwise -- no true valuation in our hearts of Christ as the Mediator.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#60:9">Page 60</a>   Our Moses is not only the Mediator to bring to us the knowledge of God in holy <b>love</b>, but He is a quickening Spirit to make us to live in the appreciation of God as He has made Him known, and He gives His Spirit so that we may respond in the liberty of holy affections to God, and move in holy affections, too, towards His people.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#60:14">Page 60</a>   God is now putting, the Spirit of the Lord -- the Spirit of Him who is the Mediator -- into millions of hearts, that they may know God in His <b>love</b>, and be able to answer to the pleasure of His <b>love</b> concerning them, and to do so in perfect liberty of heart<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#61:2">Page 61</a>  CHAPTER 6 The object which the covenant has in view, as we see at the end of the previous chapter, is that a living people are secured for the pleasure of God, and for the enjoyment of what His <b>love</b> bestows on them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#61:15">Page 61</a>   We were once in bondage to the power of the world, and it hindered us from being for the pleasure of God, but He has come in to set us free from it so that we might <b>love</b> Him and serve Him in perfect liberty<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#62:13">Page 62</a>   It represents a sphere of spiritual blessing which is according to the <b>love</b> of God ( Deuteronomy 7:8 ), and which He would have His people to possess and increase in as the true sphere of their life.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#62:14">Page 62</a>   Many of us might have some difficulty in stating what we understand by "the land", but if it is the present portion which the <b>love</b> of God would bring us into, it is well worth our while to give earnest attention to it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#63:9">Page 63</a>   But God has imperishable glory, and in the outshining of that glory He calls men in sovereign <b>love</b>, and makes Himself known to them as the God of redemption and of resurrection power, and as giving what is worthy of Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#64:4">Page 64</a>   Rut spiritual powers were present which stood against the knowledge of God; and against the realisation of what God would give in <b>love</b> to man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#64:9">Page 64</a>   "The land" speaks typically of eternal life as God's answer in <b>love</b> to all that the enemy had brought in.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#65:9">Page 65</a>  The glory of the present dispensation is that the people of God are so set in the knowledge of His <b>love</b> that they <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#65:15">Page 65</a>  "Hear, Israel: Jehovah our God is one Jehovah; and thou shalt <b>love</b> Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength", Nothing could be more blessed than to know that it is within the range of possibility that we should <b>love</b> God with our whole moral being<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#66:2">Page 66</a>   The covenant having been made known, and the Mediator being now a quickening spirit it is possible for our days to be prolonged as those who <b>love</b> God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#66:3">Page 66</a>   It is not only that the <b>love</b> of God is known, but He is loved by His people.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#66:4">Page 66</a>   Christians are characteristically "those who <b>love</b> God" ( Romans 8:28 ), and those who do so are known of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#66:5">Page 66</a>   "But if any one <b>love</b> God, he is known of him" ( 1 Corinthians 8:3 ); there is something there which God can recognise, in contrast with mere knowledge.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#66:6">Page 66</a>   <b>Love</b> is the breath of life.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#66:7">Page 66</a>   Israel in the world to come will be in eternal life; they will know God as revealed in <b>love</b> by the Mediator, and they will be quickened so as to respond to Him in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#66:8">Page 66</a>   What a delight to think of God's Israel as having every part of their moral being permeated with <b>love</b> to God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#66:10">Page 66</a>   Now the glory of the present time is that God has been made known, and the One who has made Him known is the quickening Spirit so that we might live in responsive <b>love</b> to God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#67:4">Page 67</a>   The glory of the dispensation is that God has spoken from the very depths of His nature -- from the very heart of heaven -- in unquenchable <b>love</b> that we might know Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#67:5">Page 67</a>   And the Person who is the Mediator of all this is a quickening Spirit; He gives His own Spirit to those who believe, so that it may become spiritually possible for us to <b>love</b> God with all our heart, and with all our soul, and with all our understanding, and with all our strength.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#67:9">Page 67</a>   In eternity we shall <b>love</b> God with the whole energy of our moral being.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#67:18">Page 67</a>   The mind, as well as the heart and soul and strength, may be wholly filled with <b>love</b> to God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#68:6">Page 68</a>   It never was, nor could be, secured on the line of requirement; it can be secured, blessed be God, through God revealing Himself in <b>love</b> in His Son, and through the death of Christ, and through the Spirit being given to those who believe.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#68:7">Page 68</a>   The glory of the dispensation is that God is revealed in <b>love</b>, and that those to whom He has given His Spirit know Him as thus revealed, and <b>love</b> Him, and <b>love</b> one another.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#69:3">Page 69</a>   In "the land" days are to be prolonged in <b>love</b> to God, and everything about us is to carry the impress of how we know God and delight in His will.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#69:4">Page 69</a>   Our conversation, our service, our countenances, the ordering of our houses, and what comes into them or goes out of them -- all to be suitable to those who know God and <b>love</b> Him!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#70:6">Page 70</a>   All is looked at here as given in divine <b>love</b>, and according to the promise and oath of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#70:8">Page 70</a>   It is all, as we should say in New Testament language, of the Father ( Colossians 1:12 ;  Ephesians 1:3 ); it is all the fruit of the riches of God's mercy and of His great <b>love</b>, and of the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness towards us in Christ Jesus ( Ephesians 2 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#70:9">Page 70</a>  No epistle magnifies the absoluteness of mercy, <b>love</b> and grace as Ephesians does.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#72:4">Page 72</a>   He is so pledged to them in <b>love</b> and faithfulness that to question it is to tempt Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#72:13">Page 72</a>   The swearing of the oath by Jehovah was in  Genesis 22 , after Isaac had been, in figure, offered up, and received again from the dead -- a precious type of Christ, the Son of the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#74:6">Page 74</a>  One can see the importance of the covenant having its place in view of entrance into the land, for only a people with undivided hearts -- hearts full of <b>love</b> to God -- could appreciate what He proposes to give.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#76:9">Page 76</a>  But the "heirs" have something which is even more precious than the inheritance; that is, their own relationship to the One who in <b>love</b> gives the inheritance.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#77:4">Page 77</a>   This stands connected with eternal purpose, when God had nothing to consider but how He would provide for the satisfaction of His own <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#80:1">Page 80</a>  Verses 7, 8 are a touching reminder that we owe all to sovereign <b>love</b>, and to God's faithfulness to His promise and oath.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#80:2">Page 80</a>   Rut if it is ever true that He is "the faithful God, who keepeth covenant and mercy to a thousand generations with them that <b>love</b> him and keep his commandments" (verse 9), covenant conditions on our side must be maintained, and no faithful heart would wish it to be otherwise.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#80:4">Page 80</a>   God's ways in government secure blessing to those who <b>love</b> Him and keep His ordinances, but they are solemnly retributive to those who do otherwise.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#80:5">Page 80</a>   If God gives light as to His <b>love</b> and faithfulness it is a most solemn thing not to be affected by it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#81:2">Page 81</a>   "He will <b>love</b> thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee, and will bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy ground, thy corn and thy new wine, and thine oil, the offspring of thy kine, and the increase of thy sheep, in the land which he swore unto thy fathers to give thee" (verse 13).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#81:9">Page 81</a>   Where God's <b>love</b> is complacent there will be spiritual health and increase; it will be proved that, as Solomon said, "There has not failed one word of all his good promises which he spoke through Moses his servant" ( 1 Kings 8:56 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#83:6">Page 83</a>  CHAPTER 8 This chapter brings before us in a striking way God's paternal chastening of His sons in the wilderness, and the end which His <b>love</b> has in view in that chastening.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#84:11">Page 84</a>   His ways always subserve the purposes of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#88:17">Page 88</a>   We are always sons in the thought of God; it is the blessed relationship with Himself in which His <b>love</b> has set us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#89:5">Page 89</a>   The inheritance is their God-given portion, but they themselves are His portion, His inheritance, His delight, as in the relationship which His <b>love</b> has called them into, and formed them for.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#91:1">Page 91</a>   It is the blessed thought of God, the gift of His <b>love</b>, but, from the standpoint of  Deuteronomy 8 , not yet entered upon in realisation.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#91:9">Page 91</a>   But that this is the thought of God's <b>love</b> for His people, and that this is involved in eternal life, it is impossible, in the face of Scripture, to deny.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#91:10">Page 91</a>   Let us open our hearts more fully to the precious thoughts of divine <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#96:1">Page 96</a>   "Pomegranates" are yielded by holy affections, for holiness is by <b>love</b>, not by faith.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#97:5">Page 97</a>   It would speak of the sweet "consolation of <b>love</b>" which is the product of the united activities of the saints in the divine nature.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#97:9">Page 97</a>   When we see this we begin to appreciate the essentiality of the Lord's commandment that we should "<b>love</b> one another".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#97:10">Page 97</a>   We begin to understand John's word that " we  know that we have passed from death to life, because we <b>love</b> the brethren".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#97:11">Page 97</a>   We need the gain of all that is in the brethren, and we derive it as we <b>love</b> them, and hare fellowship with one another.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#101:18">Page 101</a>   Not one of us would have continued in the divine way, or would have been brought through in any measure of faithfulness to the present time, but for that blessed service of faithful <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#102:9">Page 102</a>   How soon we left our first <b>love</b>, and allowed idolatry and evil teaching!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#104:6">Page 104</a>  CHAPTER 10 If God is to have a people for His pleasure, as redeemed and answering to His <b>love</b>, it must, be brought about, as a result of His own work in them, and of their abiding in Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#104:9">Page 104</a>   What answers to it for us is the revelation of the <b>love</b> of God in His beloved Son.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#104:10">Page 104</a>   That <b>love</b> could not be satisfied without an answer to it being produced in His people.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#104:14">Page 104</a>   Then how can God fulfil His promises, and the purposes of His <b>love</b>, and secure what His heart desires!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#107:1">Page 107</a>   And we see them in the beginning of the Acts with the covenant written on them -- knowing God's <b>love</b> and loving Him, and loving one another.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#107:14">Page 107</a>   The new covenant is consummated, as to the spirit of it, in those who know God through Christ the Mediator, and who <b>love</b> Him and <b>love</b> one another<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#109:5">Page 109</a>   But  the spirit  of the covenant was the knowledge of God as a Redeemer, Deliverer, and Saviour-God -- as One so known by "thousands" as to be the Object, on their part, of <b>love</b> and obedience.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#109:12">Page 109</a>   All that God delights in for the blessing of His creature man has been brought in on the principle of <b>love</b> and obedience as in the heart of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#111:15">Page 111</a>   Obedience and <b>love</b> as learned in Christ are to be characteristic of all those who are His.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#112:9">Page 112</a>   Where there is obedience, righteousness, and <b>love</b>, there is moral correspondence with Christ as the "ark of wood".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#113:1">Page 113</a>   John does not speak in terms of the covenant, but he gives us the substance and vitality of it as made good in a company who know the <b>love</b> of God, and who respond to it, and who <b>love</b> one another.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#117:9">Page 117</a>   It is a persistent service of faithful <b>love</b> which He carries on through the whole period which is typified by the "forty days and forty nights" of Moses intercession.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#119:13">Page 119</a>   When Paul asks, "Who shall separate us from the <b>love</b> of Christ?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#119:14">Page 119</a>  " he is thinking of the <b>love</b> in which He intercedes for us at the right hand of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#120:9">Page 120</a>  Now God is to be feared, and loved, and served, and obeyed in the light of His sovereign <b>love</b> and choice, and the pleasure which He has in His people.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#120:10">Page 120</a>   "Jehovah took pleasure in thy fathers, to <b>love</b> them, and he chose their seed after them, even you, out of all the peoples, as it is this day" (verse 15).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#121:1">Page 121</a>   And ye shall <b>love</b> the stranger; for ye have been strangers in the land of Egypt".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#121:3">Page 121</a>   It shows how God would have His people to enjoy all that His <b>love</b> and purpose have conferred on them in a spirit of grace and consideration that is like His own.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#121:10">Page 121</a>   It is in the light of these things having been known that we are to <b>love</b> God, "and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his ordinances, and his commandments continually" (verses 1 - 9).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#124:7">Page 124</a>   It contains "Things which eye has not, seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that <b>love</b> him, but God has revealed to us by his Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#125:11">Page 125</a>  The inheritance is the fruit of the <b>love</b> of God; John says, "See what <b>love</b> the Father has given to us, that we should be called the children of God".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#125:15">Page 125</a>   The <b>love</b> of God ever cherishes the inheritance for us and cherishes us for the inheritance; the youngest believer is entitled to take that home to himself in all its blessedness<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#126:4">Page 126</a>   It is purely a question of God's sovereign <b>love</b>, and of where it has given us our portion.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#126:6">Page 126</a>   There is a region where divine pleasure dwells, where the <b>love</b> of God is known, where His Son is the Object of faith and <b>love</b>, where the Comforter abides, and the brethren <b>love</b> one another, where eternal life is given to those whom the Father has given to the Son.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#127:3">Page 127</a>   It has been before Him from the outset, and it has continued before Him all through the centuries of the assembly's history, and His eyes are upon it still as that which His <b>love</b> has purposed for men.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#127:7">Page 127</a>  Obedience and <b>love</b> are the conditions on which "the land" can be possessed and enjoyed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#127:11">Page 127</a>   But the keeping of commandments flows from <b>love</b>; the gospel by revealing the <b>love</b> of God puts a spring of <b>love</b> in our hearts which would never otherwise be there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#127:12">Page 127</a>   Then it is also true that the saints are begotten of God, and as such they <b>love</b> Him, and they <b>love</b> those begotten of Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#131:4">Page 131</a>  The land is properly the sphere of life; it is where saints live in the blessed conditions which God has established in His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#131:7">Page 131</a>   But he adds, "if any one <b>love</b> God, he is known of him".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#131:8">Page 131</a>   If our affections have found their Object and Centre in God -- and He has revealed Himself in grace and <b>love</b> to that end -- it will bring the pleasure of God into every detail.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#131:11">Page 131</a>   We <b>love</b> because He first loved us; it was He who set all in motion by revealing His own <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#134:5">Page 134</a>   Good is supreme there, the will of God is there, the <b>love</b> of God, and the mutual flow of holy affections!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#134:7">Page 134</a>  As we move on in obedience and <b>love</b> God will dispossess every adverse power before us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#134:13">Page 134</a>   Whether He sets forth God in grace or government, in boundless <b>love</b> and mercy, or in the unsparing and eternal judgment of evil, we can open our hearts unquestioningly to it, knowing that we shall never find that we have been misled.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#135:2">Page 135</a>   God's purpose is that His people should be completely victorious over every adverse power, and that they should stand in the possession and enjoyment of all that is in the thought of His <b>love</b> for them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#136:2">Page 136</a>   The epistles to the Romans and to the Galatians bring out the grace and <b>love</b> of God very fully, but they both recognise His government also, and in connection with it blessing and curse.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#136:10">Page 136</a>   We are to flee from everything of that kind, "And pursue righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart" ( 2 Timothy 2:22 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#137:8">Page 137</a>   It is the thought of divine <b>love</b> for us; we get the inheritance purely by the <b>love</b> and calling of God -- by the gift and appointment of the One who bestows it in <b>love</b> upon us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#138:3">Page 138</a>   We were born anew, and redeemed by the precious blood of Christ, that we might possess the inheritance which the <b>love</b> of God designed for us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#138:7">Page 138</a>   This is a primary consideration for those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#142:4">Page 142</a>   In Colossians we are viewed as translated by the Father "into the kingdom of the Son of his <b>love</b>", and in Ephesians we read of "inheritance in the kingdom of the Christ and God".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#145:8">Page 145</a>  If God is revealed and known as the Father His <b>love</b> places His saints in a relationship in which they can suitably and affectionately answer to that revelation.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#149:7">Page 149</a>   God would enrich us in our own "gates" with the preciousness of Christ, and then lead us to bring it to the place where He sets His Name that He may have what is due from the hearts that <b>love</b> Him, and that we may enjoy it in a deeper and fuller way in conscious nearness to God in His assembly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#150:12">Page 150</a>   We are now under obligation to withdraw from iniquity, and purify ourselves from vessels to dishonour in separating from them, and to "pursue righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart" ( 2 Timothy 2:19  - 22).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#154:6">Page 154</a>   Many quietly accept that the inheritance is given to them in the <b>love</b> of God, and they perhaps know what it is to be under showers of blessing in the way of ministry, but they are indolent and slothful, they are not carrying out diligently what Scripture calls "the business of your hand".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#154:14">Page 154</a>   If we accept that divine <b>love</b> has given us the inheritance let us cultivate it with purpose of heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#160:8">Page 160</a>   "For Jehovah your God proveth you, to know whether ye <b>love</b> Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your soul".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#160:9">Page 160</a>   We shall find that all these prophets and dreamers, while they may speak "swelling words", and even quote Scripture largely -- as did also their master the devil -- speak "revolt" against "Our God whom we have known,   Well known in Jesus' <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#161:4">Page 161</a>   They do not recall to us that we have been set free from everything that once held us in bondage, and that God in the fulness of His <b>love</b> has delighted to give us His Spirit, and to bring us to the abode of His holiness, and to bless us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#163:16">Page 163</a>   Peter might well speak of Paul afterwards as "our beloved brother Paul"; no doubt he felt deeply how much he owed to Paul's faithful <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#165:3">Page 165</a>   Sonship is the relationship in which we stand, through infinite <b>love</b>, to the blessed God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#167:15">Page 167</a>  Let us not be content to have the light of sonship as the blessed relationship to which God has called us in infinite <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#175:9">Page 175</a>   We know that it is the thought, and purpose of God's <b>love</b> that we should be His sons in Christ Jesus by faith.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#181:8">Page 181</a>  The favour and <b>love</b> of God bestows the inheritance.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#187:1">Page 187</a>   The effect of making a release is that in my spirit I am in the liberty of grace and <b>love</b> towards my debtor.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#190:5">Page 190</a>   If he comes into permanent obligation it must be entirely in the freedom of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#190:8">Page 190</a>   Both the master and the bondman are thus seen to be true "sons of Jehovah", acting in a spirit of <b>love</b>, and bound together in that spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#191:4">Page 191</a>   His pleasure in His saints will be secured as these things are taken up, and the thought of this makes them intensely interesting and attractive to those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#191:9">Page 191</a>   Before He had said anything of the passover He made known to Pharaoh the peculiar place that Israel had in the purpose of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#191:11">Page 191</a>   In sovereign <b>love</b> He gave them that place for His own pleasure.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#191:14">Page 191</a>   It is true of us also that sonship is our chief glory, conferred upon us by God's sovereign <b>love</b> for His own delight.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#192:4">Page 192</a>   God let out to him the great thought of His <b>love</b> about His people.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#192:14">Page 192</a>   We see in Ephesians that God marked us out for sonship before the foundation of the world, and it was  to Himself ; that is, it was for the pleasure of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#192:16">Page 192</a>   Behind it was the precious thought of divine <b>love</b> that God would have sons<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#193:1">Page 193</a>   "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ; according as he has chosen us in him before the world's foundation, that we should be holy and blameless before him in <b>love</b>; having marked us out beforehand for adoption (sonship) through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has taken us into favour in the Beloved".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#193:11">Page 193</a>   Redemption is the righteous title of God to carry out the pleasure of His <b>love</b> in regard of those who have been sinful.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#194:1">Page 194</a>   This gives us the true thought of the Passover; it is God passing the wing of His protecting <b>love</b> in the power of redemption over His people as a covering so that the destroyer is not suffered to enter; His people's houses are delivered.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#194:6">Page 194</a>   He has secured something which has excellence and dignity, firstborn character, for the pleasure of His own <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#195:15">Page 195</a>   We need a greater consciousness of the place which has been accorded to us in the sovereignty of divine <b>love</b>, through redemption.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#196:20">Page 196</a>   God delights to have it so; it is what He has proposed for the satisfaction of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#197:8">Page 197</a>  The firstborn among kine and sheep would be typical of that character of sonship which has been seen in Christ, and which is now conferred in sovereign <b>love</b> upon the many sons His brethren, and which is for the delight of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#198:1">Page 198</a>   It is the communion of His saints together in feeding on the precious thoughts of His <b>love</b> as brought out in connection with what has the character of firstborn.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#200:9">Page 200</a>   It is the purpose of His <b>love</b>, and He would have it to form the substance of our communion together before Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#200:14">Page 200</a>   The Spirit of God's Son will never deviate from what is suitable to the relationship which divine <b>love</b> has given us<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#201:11">Page 201</a>   If God has taken us up in <b>love</b> as His "firstborn", as we have seen in connection with the firstlings, it is requisite that He should deliver us from "the present evil world", and that we should be in moral separation from the flesh which is corrupt and corrupting<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#203:8">Page 203</a>  God works out all the designs of His <b>love</b> by bringing in Christ as the slain Lamb.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#204:6">Page 204</a>   The uniform testimony of Scripture is that by the passover God was acting in <b>love</b> for the redemption of His people, having regard to His covenant and His wondrous thoughts of favour towards them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#205:8">Page 205</a>   God has moved in <b>love</b> to bring a people forth from sin, the world and Satan, from all that marks man as in the flesh.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#205:9">Page 205</a>   In doing this He had before Him His purpose to have His firstborn, and to place him in the inheritance which His <b>love</b> would bestow in "a good and spacious land".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#205:10">Page 205</a>   The death of Christ is very precious to God as that by which He gives effect to the great designs of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#208:13">Page 208</a>   The life of the flesh is under judgment with God, and has been brought to an end in the death of Christ, who bore its judgment in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#211:6">Page 211</a>   It recalls how  He  devoted Himself in <b>love</b> -- the true Hebrew Servant who has said, "I <b>love</b> my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go free".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#211:8">Page 211</a>   It is the remembrance suited iii the thought of His <b>love</b> to those who are in the place of His intimate associates who cherish His memory -- those who are in the favoured place of being His loved household.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#219:14">Page 219</a>   God would not have us to stop short of the crown of His year; He would have us to come to the full measure of His thought, and the purpose of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#225:2">Page 225</a>   Then the brethren are loved as those begotten of God and called to enjoy together in family affections the children's portion, " We  know that we have passed from death to life, because we <b>love</b> the brethren" ( 1 John 3:14 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#226:10">Page 226</a>   Things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that <b>love</b> him, but God has revealed to us by his Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God" ( 1 Corinthians 2:6  - 10).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#226:18">Page 226</a>   We have obtained an inheritance in Christ; God has given it to us in <b>love</b> according to His eternal purpose; He would enlighten our hearts as to it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#227:9">Page 227</a>   If our fellow saints could see that we were in the joy of a communion to which they were as much entitled as we are, and that we were going out to them in affectionate desire that they should participate in it, I feel sure it would make an impression on those who <b>love</b> God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#228:8">Page 228</a>   His thoughts of <b>love</b> are unchanged and undiminished, and He is working by His Spirit to bring us back to them, so that the joy of them may characterise the communion of His saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#229:13">Page 229</a>   The principle on which we go on together is "with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, bearing with one another in <b>love</b>" ( Ephesians 4:2 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#236:2">Page 236</a>   What an activity of faithful <b>love</b> in our own "gates" before the case is carried to the supreme court, the assembly!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#243:8">Page 243</a>   Paul tells us that he was a model ( Philippians 3:17 ), and he exhorts Timothy to be "a model of the believers, in word, in conduct, in <b>love</b>, in faith, in purity" ( 1 Timothy 4:12 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#245:6">Page 245</a>   As "the people of the land" we live upon what the <b>love</b> of God has given  to men ; as priests we live upon what is  for God .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#250:7">Page 250</a>   The Lord in  John 14:21  - 23 reserves most wondrous privilege for the individual lover, and it is by personal <b>love</b> and obedience, and keeping His word, that all can be secured now that answers to the place which Jehovah chose.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#257:11">Page 257</a>   The cities of refuge suggest a character of dwelling in the land which greatly magnifies the sovereign <b>love</b> and mercy of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#260:13">Page 260</a>   So that now if saints would live in the divine inheritance they can only do so by withdrawing from iniquity, by purging themselves from vessels to dishonour, and by pursuing righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#268:18">Page 268</a>   For God has not given us a spirit, of cowardice, but of power, and of <b>love</b>, and of wise discretion" ( 2 Timothy 1:6 , 7), he was giving him priestly encouragement, and emboldening him to go on with the battle.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#278:4">Page 278</a>  CHAPTER 22 This section of the book brings out principles which are very important in relation to the "labour of <b>love</b>" which is to go on in the land.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#278:9">Page 278</a>   If I am thinking of myself, I am not serving in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#278:12">Page 278</a>   The care and service of Christ is with a view to our getting the good of all that belongs to us through the all-blessing grace and <b>love</b> of our God, and we are to have a like care for our brother.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#282:10">Page 282</a>   What a "labour of <b>love</b>" does this entail!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#292:13">Page 292</a>   The enemy is at work to bring reproach on our virginity, but we see the energy of divine <b>love</b> in Paul, and his faithful labour that we may be clear of that reproach, and that it may become manifest that we have chaste virgin character as maintained in true-hearted devotedness to the One to whom we belong<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#293:11">Page 293</a>   All His service of <b>love</b> has that in view.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#294:3">Page 294</a>   The word translated "congregation" is only used before in this book with reference to the assembly at Horeb; the Greek translators rendered it  ecclesia , and the fact that the Lord used this word to designate  His  assembly gives it deep interest for those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#300:14">Page 300</a>  The fullest exemplification of One with the vows of God upon Him was the Lord Jesus Himself; He was the true Nazarite, and His self-dedication in <b>love</b> as the Hebrew Servant ( Exodus 21:5 ) was in the true spirit of a vow.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#303:1">Page 303</a>   But it is always after much long-suffering that God disowns what has stood in relation to Him; He lingers over it in the reluctance of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#303:2">Page 303</a>   The secret of all departure is getting away from the consciousness of divine <b>love</b>; then unseemly things come in; leaving first <b>love</b> opens the door for other things to come in.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#303:4">Page 303</a>   But His appeals to the assemblies shew the reluctance of His <b>love</b> to break off relations; even to Laodicea He says, "Behold I stand at the door and am knocking".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#304:7">Page 304</a>   Israel and Judah went after "many lovers", but the faithful <b>love</b> of Jehovah yearned for their return to Him, and He will yet bring it to pass in His mercy.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#304:14">Page 304</a>   Let us beware of decline in the appreciation of divine <b>love</b>, and the weakening of affectionate fidelity to Christ, for if we begin to slip away there is no telling how far we may go!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#305:2">Page 305</a>   But verse 5 views the assembly as the product of the work of God and the subject of the complacent <b>love</b> of Christ -- His blest companion, gladdened by Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#305:12">Page 305</a>   Our response in affection to Him will be commensurate with our apprehension and appreciation of His <b>love</b> and service.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#305:14">Page 305</a>   The assembly is subjected to the Christ as her Head; she is subjected to His <b>love</b> and to <b>love</b>'s service and gladdening; she appreciates and enjoys it<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#306:9">Page 306</a>   The undivided attention and <b>love</b> of Christ for the assembly could never be without spiritual result.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#306:10">Page 306</a>   I do not doubt that through the dark ages there have been those whose hearts have been kept in the consciousness of the <b>love</b> of Christ, and who have proved the fidelity of His service.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#306:11">Page 306</a>  If we are not gladdened as the result of the activities of the <b>love</b> of Christ towards us it intimates that there may be some unseemly thing with us; it raises a serious exercise.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#306:12">Page 306</a>  There is that in the public profession which has been, or will be, sent away as divorced; but there is something which will not be sent away, but which will be cherished and gladdened by the <b>love</b> of Christ through time and to eternity<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#307:1">Page 307</a>   An individual appreciation of the <b>love</b> of Christ prepares us to appreciate His <b>love</b> for the assembly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#307:2">Page 307</a>   We learn to take account of the whole company that stands in relation to Him as Head, and is His counterpart, His own flesh, the subject of His <b>love</b> and service.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#310:14">Page 310</a>   We are to remember that we were bondmen in Egypt, and that we have been redeemed in God's <b>love</b> and pity from thence, and that is to have such an effect upon us that the same spirit in which God has acted towards us becomes active in us towards others.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#312:6">Page 312</a>  Paul contrasts the "rod" with "<b>love</b> and a spirit of meekness" ( 1 Corinthians 4:21 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#313:6">Page 313</a>   Even his sin is to bring out the true character of righteousness and <b>love</b> in the brethren; they are to pray for him in view of his having life given to him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#313:9">Page 313</a>   If we do what is inconsistent with the principles of the kingdom we shall get stripes ( Colossians 3:25 ); if we engage in the patient labour of <b>love</b>, like the ox treading out the corn (verse 4) we shall not go unrecompensed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#314:2">Page 314</a>  Then Jehovah foresaw that death would come in, even in favoured Israel, and that if names were not to be blotted out from the inheritance they must be secured by one who would in unselfish <b>love</b> build up a house and raise up a name on behalf of the dead.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#319:12">Page 319</a>   We can speak, too, of the sovereign <b>love</b> that has wrought so wondrously to secure it to us, and to secure us for it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#320:11">Page 320</a>   It is a wondrous thought that the blessed God should find His happiness in seeing us happy before Him in conscious possession of what His <b>love</b> has given.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#321:15">Page 321</a>   We often delight to sing together: "Father, Thy sovereign <b>love</b> has sought  Captives to sin, gone far from Thee;  The work that Thine own Son hath wrought   Has brought us back in peace and free",  This gives its own peculiar note to Deuteronomic worship; and there cannot be joy in all the good that God has given to us apart from the recognition and consciousness of how all has been brought about by grace and sovereign <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#322:2">Page 322</a>   Nothing is more nourishing than milk; it speaks of that which ministers to growth, and of the <b>love</b> in which Christ nourishes the assembly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#322:3">Page 322</a>   While honey would suggest the activity of divine <b>love</b> in the saints promoting mutual and collective labour to secure what is sweet and refreshing so that it may be available for all.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#323:9">Page 323</a>  As walking in <b>love</b>, in deed and in truth, we can say before God that we are doing so; He loves that we should be able to say it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#323:10">Page 323</a>   It is, in a typical form, what John says; "Children, let us not <b>love</b> with word, nor with tongue, but in deed and in truth.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#323:13">Page 323</a>   We not only walk in <b>love</b>, according to God's commandments, but we can  say  before Him that we are doing so, and count upon Him for blessing<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#324:10">Page 324</a>   This is blessing conditional upon the obedience of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#326:2">Page 326</a>   This is for Israel the consummation of what <b>love</b> has purposed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#329:5">Page 329</a>   But we should not like to think of the Deuteronomic law, expressing the good pleasure of God for His people as in the land, being "effaced"; on the contrary it is to be written "very plainly" by a people who delight in it, and <b>love</b> to give It abiding expression.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#331:3">Page 331</a>   He has companions who also, like Him, <b>love</b> righteousness and hate lawlessness, and true gladness is found on this line.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#331:9">Page 331</a>   "If any one <b>love</b> not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be Anathema Maran-atha" ( 1 Corinthians 16:22 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#334:3">Page 334</a>   Not that this could be measured by mere increase of numbers -- though we would <b>love</b> to see this in a godly way -- but by spiritual fruitfulness which yields increasing pleasure to God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#335:2">Page 335</a>   Paul exhorted Timothy to "Have an outline of sound words, which words thou hast heard of me, in faith and <b>love</b> which are in Christ Jesus" ( 2 Timothy 1:13 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#337:5">Page 337</a>   The covenant would be of no value to Him unless it were intelligently entered into by a people who have learned to know and <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#338:6">Page 338</a>   It is, to us, a direct appeal of Christ, in view of our affectionately and intelligently entering into all that divine <b>love</b> has purposed for us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#341:11">Page 341</a>   The purpose of His <b>love</b>, and the calling of His people, are just the same as at the beginning.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#341:12">Page 341</a>   Christ has not left His first <b>love</b>, and His thoughts of the assembly are unchanged and undiminished.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#349:1">Page 349</a>  All that Joshua represents has been, and ever will be, supported by God, and it will ever lead the people of God into the inheritance which His <b>love</b> has prepared for them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#351:3">Page 351</a>   There is, indeed, no higher or more glorious feature of God's assembly than that He there makes known the pleasure of His <b>love</b>, and His mind in regard to all that constitutes His glory in that assembly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#353:9">Page 353</a>   He will carry through the purposes of His <b>love</b> in spite of everything.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#357:4">Page 357</a>   He will see that they are brought into all that His <b>love</b> would give after having been deprived of it by the enemy through their own folly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#360:9">Page 360</a>   But he brings out the wealth of what can be enjoyed with God by those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#361:5">Page 361</a>  The introduction (verses 2 - 6) and the conclusion (verses 26 - 29) are general; the one shewing the origin of all blessing in the movements of God in <b>love</b>, and the other giving the result, in security and happiness, to an upright people who know Him as their God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#361:9">Page 361</a>   That was the place where He made known the requirements of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#361:10">Page 361</a>   We are justified in so regarding it, even apart from the direct statement of the next verse, for if He had not loved the people He would not have sought their <b>love</b>, nor been jealous of every influence that would divert their affections from Him<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#362:1">Page 362</a>   If God moves from the point of what His <b>love</b> requires, He will not fail to secure it; He moves that His heart may be satisfied by bringing about in His people a full answer to all that He desires.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#362:6">Page 362</a>   We may be forty years in coming to it that we can only reach divine things by the Spirit, but God's movements in <b>love</b> began with that as a starting-point, and He will never deviate from it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#363:1">Page 363</a>   He moved in <b>love</b>, with unalloyed blessing in His heart and in His ways.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#363:4">Page 363</a>   He had purposes from eternity, formed in Christ, to have a vast company "holy and blameless before him in <b>love</b>" ( Ephesians 1:4 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#363:5">Page 363</a>   He will secure those "holy myriads" by working in sovereign electing <b>love</b>; He moves from that point in such a way as to secure it fully that His <b>love</b> may be satisfied.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#363:8">Page 363</a>   Spiritual guidance is assured as we move in the light of the movements of God; the strength of His right hand is then for and with us To have such a "law" is a very definite mark of divine favour, for it is the mandate of a <b>love</b> which delights that we shall move with Him even amidst surrounding darkness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#363:9">Page 363</a>  "Yea, he loveth the peoples" (verse 3) is a precious word, especially for the "other sheep" which are not of the Jewish fold, for it takes in Gentiles, and intimates that God's movements in <b>love</b> have a wide bearing; they have regard to the many who, through the word of His servants, are invited to the mountain of blessing by the call of His grace (verse 19).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#364:4">Page 364</a>   As subdued by divine <b>love</b>, the place is taken which Mary took of sitting at the feet of Jesus and listening to His word.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#364:6">Page 364</a>  The law, as commanded by Christ, is "the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob" (verse 4), for it expresses the pleasure of God's <b>love</b> concerning us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#365:4">Page 365</a>   It is not a law as a mere code of rules, but the powerful and affecting influence of a living Person who has acquired kingly rights in the way of infinite <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#365:7">Page 365</a>   We shall only learn the meaning of this chapter as we come under His blessed rule; its spiritual reality can only be known in the kingdom of the Son of the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#367:9">Page 367</a>   They find themselves out of accord with their old worldly associations, and they realise that  their  people now are those who fear and <b>love</b> God, and are under His blessing.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#371:5">Page 371</a>   It is a lovely picture of complacent and restful <b>love</b> known in the closest intimacy; the language used reminds our hearts of those utterances of mutual and fervent affection which are found in the Song of Songs.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#371:8">Page 371</a>   Priestly intelligence is great divine favour, but it is to be accompanied by the consciousness of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#372:14">Page 372</a>   The thought of it surely draws us to Him to dwell in safety by Him, for our hearts are only safe in nearness to His known and trusted <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#372:18">Page 372</a>   We keep ourselves in the <b>love</b> of God as we dwell in safety by Him, but it is by  His  keeping and covering that we are retained for the pleasure of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#373:1">Page 373</a>   The "shoulders" speak of the strength of His people's <b>love</b> as the breasts denote its warmth and tenderness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#373:3">Page 373</a>   Tender affections cherish the Lord as known in His precious suffering <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#373:5">Page 373</a>   It suggests a strength in His people's affections that will preserve a place for Him against every aggressor; He is defended by faithful <b>love</b> from every hostile attack.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#373:11">Page 373</a>   While the great ones in the religious world are making more and more manifest that they do not <b>love</b> our Lord Jesus Christ it may be ours to maintain for Him a secure place in face of all His adversaries.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#375:14">Page 375</a>   And "the deep that lieth beneath" is surely figurative of the death of Christ as underlying all, and securing all in righteousness and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#381:7">Page 381</a>   Spiritual energy is needed to "spring forth" into it, and that energy comes of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#381:13">Page 381</a>   The ark was with the people for thirty-eight years in the wilderness, indicating how God would make Christ known to us in His greatness and preciousness as the One in whom is secured and preserved every thought of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#382:1">Page 382</a>   The things which God has prepared for them that <b>love</b> Him are on that side; it is spiritual ground, and spiritual energy is needed to "spring forth" to take possession of it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#382:17">Page 382</a>   The <b>love</b> of God expressed and satisfied in what He gives, and men brought to supreme satisfaction in receiving it<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#383:3">Page 383</a>   The favour and the blessing are there for us, the free gift of <b>love</b>, and they are to be enjoyed in God, and in His beloved Son, by the Holy Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#383:15">Page 383</a>   It is the gift of <b>love</b> for all.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac5.htm#384:3">Page 384</a>   Many of us need to be awakened to a sense of the greatness of what the <b>love</b> of God would give us as a present portion.<br>
<h3>Volume 6 - An Outline of Joshua, Judges and Ruth</h3>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#2:12">Page 2</a>  The Spirit of Christ is intensely set on bringing the people of God into everything that the <b>love</b> of God has purposed for them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#2:15">Page 2</a>   It is a wonderful thing to recognise that there is spiritual power adequate to cause us to inherit all that God has given us in the purpose of His <b>love</b>; that is the element we want to strengthen and encourage.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#4:2">Page 4</a>   The Spirit of Christ would always lead into the purposes of God's <b>love</b>; and on the other hand the law would be preserved in all its integrity, and the book that was written.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#12:9">Page 12</a>   If Rahab had not been drawn with cords of <b>love</b> she would not have had any reason to link herself with the people of God and with the servants of God; she definitely linked herself with them when she let them down by a cord, and the men never forgot it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#15:13">Page 15</a>   He is the ark of the covenant; all is secured in Him and presented to us in Him so that we might learn to value and <b>love</b> that Person, and be deeply interested in His movements.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#17:13">Page 17</a>   It makes one <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#17:14">Page 17</a>   You go into the holiest and contemplate Him and you <b>love</b> Him; and as you <b>love</b> Him you are prepared to follow Him wherever He moves.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#18:16">Page 18</a>   No man could ever have entered that new state, so as to live in it for the pleasure of divine <b>love</b>, if Christ had not died.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#18:19">Page 18</a>  The wonderful thing is that it was in the days of harvest when the ark went into Jordan: that is, the full power of death was never known or could be known until the time came for God to give fruition to all the thoughts of His own <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#18:20">Page 18</a>   God has in view the securing of the fruition of all that is in His own purpose of <b>love</b> for man, but that is brought to light through the power of death as it was never known before<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#19:14">Page 19</a>   That is, there is a region which faith can contemplate where there is nothing but the will of God, where there is all the delightful product of God's <b>love</b>, a region filled with the things which divine <b>love</b> has prepared for those that <b>love</b> God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#21:19">Page 21</a>   It is not His taking up need on our side, but He has taken up the thoughts of divine <b>love</b>, and He has been into death in order that every one of those thoughts might come into fruition.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#24:2">Page 24</a>  We learn to <b>love</b> the Lord through the testimony that has been brought to us by men who walked in company with Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#31:5">Page 31</a>   We are privileged to feed on that -- the old corn -- and apprehend God's purpose of <b>love</b> and His own delight in a Man in a new place and condition.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#38:2">Page 38</a>   We can see the power of the enemy at Ephesus; the walls of Jericho had fallen at Ephesus with a tremendous crash, but the enemy went to work in a subtle way to displace the ark in the affections of the people of God, so the Lord had to say that they had left their first <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#64:16">Page 64</a>   Caleb brought word as it was in his heart; the land was in Caleb's heart according to the <b>love</b> that had given it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#64:17">Page 64</a>   He had Jehovah before him, and Jehovah had given the land in <b>love</b> to His people; therefore it must be a very, very good land.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#68:4">Page 68</a>   It is "If ye <b>love</b> me" -- it is all conditional on that.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#68:6">Page 68</a>   It is all a question of "If ye <b>love</b> me".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#68:15">Page 68</a>   We have considered Caleb in chapter 14, and have seen in him, not simply faith, but the energy of <b>love</b> in which he wholly followed Jehovah.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#68:16">Page 68</a>   It is <b>love</b> that can truly take account of the purposes and pleasure of God in regard to the inheritance.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#68:20">Page 68</a>   I think that it is only <b>love</b> that can enter into God's delight in blessing His people.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#69:1">Page 69</a>   Timothy, in the New Testament, corresponds with Caleb as one who fully followed up what Paul had set forth in regard to the purpose of God, the delight of God in His purposes of <b>love</b>; he was one who wholly followed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#69:11">Page 69</a>  Now I think we see in Achsah the product of the energy of <b>love</b> in Caleb.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#70:11">Page 70</a>   If there is the energy of <b>love</b>, the spiritual state seen in Achsah will result.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#72:5">Page 72</a>  CHAPTERS 16 - 19 I believe that there is a very general desire among the people of God to enjoy that which God in <b>love</b> has made their portion.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#72:6">Page 72</a>   I trust we are all animated by the desire to honour God, by the appreciation and enjoyment of that which His <b>love</b> has given us at the present time.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#76:5">Page 76</a>   When the assemblies in Macedonia sent a contribution to the poor saints in Judaea, it was two tribes linked together in the bonds of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#78:16">Page 78</a>   That is a great test and involves a tax on Judah's <b>love</b> for his brother.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#78:19">Page 78</a>   So the borders of the land give occasion for the development of <b>love</b>: "with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, bearing with one another in <b>love</b>; using diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace",  Ephesians 4:2 , 3.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#85:15">Page 85</a>   If I enjoy what His <b>love</b> has given, that is very blessed; nothing could be more blessed for the creature; but is it to stop there?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#87:11">Page 87</a>   Then in coming together to eat the Lord's supper we do not lose sight of our side; it is a most precious ministry to us of the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#89:13">Page 89</a>   They have a great deal, a divinely assigned portion; but the question for us is, Have we all that God in <b>love</b> has given?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#91:11">Page 91</a>   The west side is what His <b>love</b> delights in.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#91:12">Page 91</a>   Do we <b>love</b> God enough to be able to say truly that nothing will satisfy us to receive but what satisfies God to give?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#91:14">Page 91</a>   What does the <b>love</b> of God give?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#91:15">Page 91</a>   If I get some apprehension of what the <b>love</b> of God may give, nothing less will do for me.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#91:18">Page 91</a>   They were exceedingly jealous for God's name and divine principles; they did not tolerate any kind of evil, but the Lord says, You have left your first <b>love</b>; you have fallen; repent, and do the first works.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#93:10">Page 93</a>   These men were prepared to exterminate Reuben and Gad, not because they did not <b>love</b> them, but because they loved Jehovah and considered for Him and for His people -- everything must be sacrificed to that.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#95:2">Page 95</a>   Paul was privileged to be the vessel of everything that God purposed in <b>love</b> to give His people; he brought it all out.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#95:3">Page 95</a>   All he has unfolded in the epistles to the Colossians and Ephesians, all that is connected with resurrection, being risen with Christ, being raised up together and seated in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus -- that is the inheritance, all that is in the <b>love</b> of God and in the mind of God to bestow on His people.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#95:6">Page 95</a>   If we read Ephesians we shall see that nothing has failed that God has brought to pass in the purpose of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#96:17">Page 96</a>   That is the covenant, it is the presentation to our hearts of all the blessed God is in His <b>love</b>, coming out to us through the death of Christ to bless us infinitely according to His own heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#96:18">Page 96</a>   We are apt to overlook the immense importance of a people being secured through the covenant to <b>love</b> God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#96:19">Page 96</a>   I do not know that in the New Testament, in the teaching of the epistles, there is any command to <b>love</b> God, but it is distinctly stated that there are certain persons that <b>love</b> God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#96:20">Page 96</a>   In a sense it is a characteristic designation of the saints that they <b>love</b> God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#96:21">Page 96</a>  Now we come to just two sets of influences: that is the influence of the <b>love</b> of God known in the bond of the covenant by His people; and then another set of influences represented by the nations of Canaan, the effect of which would be to entirely counteract the divine influence.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#97:11">Page 97</a>   It is impossible to maintain <b>love</b> to God under those conditions.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#98:10">Page 98</a>  There is nothing more encouraging to me than that the divine proposal is to <b>love</b> God with my whole mind and heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#98:18">Page 98</a>   was a long way beyond me, but I am encouraged by the divine proposal that we are to <b>love</b> God with all our hearts and all our souls, all our minds and all our strength.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#98:22">Page 98</a>   We think that God is demanding what we cannot give, but He is proposing the necessities of His own <b>love</b>; He is proposing a thought of supreme blessedness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#98:33">Page 98</a>   Are we living in the inheritance and enjoying it, loving God and enjoying all that His <b>love</b> gives, or have we some link with the nations, some underground passage which keeps up the connection with the influences of the world that are all contrary to God<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#99:21">Page 99</a>   He thought of the effect of it on our spirits, the effect of His own <b>love</b>, so that that <b>love</b> might be impressed more deeply every first day of the week in indelible characters on our affections, so that we might <b>love</b> the Lord Jesus Christ and God, and thus enjoy the inheritance.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#103:2">Page 103</a>   An Israelite could never look up without seeing the cloud of God's protecting <b>love</b>, as though God were saying, I am favourable to you.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#105:25">Page 105</a>   He speaks to the Ephesians as a quickened company, who through the great mercy and <b>love</b> of God had been brought to know something of the new man, the one body, access to the Father, being built together as a habitation of God in the Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#106:7">Page 106</a>   This chapter would witness to us that whatever God may have done for us, however great the extent of His <b>love</b> and power, the elements of idolatry remain with us and have to be refused.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#106:11">Page 106</a>   There are always the elements in the human heart that will rob us of the enjoyment of God, and then we cannot <b>love</b> or serve Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#106:12">Page 106</a>   What extreme folly it is to turn aside from the One who has done everything for us and who has made Himself known in supreme <b>love</b> to us -- to turn from such a God as that to another!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#107:19">Page 107</a>   We need the blessed God who in grace and <b>love</b> is the source of every supply.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#108:12">Page 108</a>   The word 'fear' is not so much used now as in olden times, but we need the fear of God to regulate the conscience and the <b>love</b> of God to regulate the affections.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#114:24">Page 114</a>   He had been the centre for holding them together by the power of His own <b>love</b>, so when He was going away He said that the essential thing for us is to <b>love</b> one another.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#115:6">Page 115</a>   It is not here so much a question of faith but of <b>love</b>.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#118:6">Page 118</a>   "We know that we have passed from death to life, because we <b>love</b> the brethren",  1 John 3:14 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#118:7">Page 118</a>   It is because we <b>love</b> God that we <b>love</b> the brethren.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#119:22">Page 119</a>   It is <b>love</b> that is in authority; that is why His commandments are not grievous.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#119:23">Page 119</a>   There is not a single commandment that has not come with the authority of <b>love</b>.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#140:18">Page 140</a>   But let them that <b>love</b> him be as the rising of the sun in its might".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#141:5">Page 141</a>   How much are we enjoying the "things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that <b>love</b> him",  1 Corinthians 2:9 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#146:4">Page 146</a>   Do I <b>love</b> the people of God so much that I would like to be retained?<br>

<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#152:5">Page 152</a>   The life of Jesus is <b>love</b> in activity.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#166:11">Page 166</a>   Deuteronomy speaks of choice vows; it supposes the people of God are so filled up with the blessing of God and the <b>love</b> of God that they want to give some of it to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#168:10">Page 168</a>   They were marked by suffering <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#174:19">Page 174</a>   It requires the co-operative activities of <b>love</b>, and no Philistine can take part in it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#174:23">Page 174</a>   He delights to partake of the fruit of the mutual activities of <b>love</b> amongst His people.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#174:24">Page 174</a>   On the ground of the death of Christ such conditions can be brought about; we can have food and sweetness as the result of the mutual activities of <b>love</b>, and the first acting of divine power is to bring that about<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#175:12">Page 175</a>   The Lord came back in resurrection to eat the honeycomb; He came to see the fruit of His death, and He found the disciples together in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#175:15">Page 175</a>   The honeycomb is the result of the mutual activity of <b>love</b> amongst the saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#176:3">Page 176</a>   That results in the mutual working of the company in <b>love</b> which produces food and sweetness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#185:5">Page 185</a>   The natural conscience can take account of the former, but it needs real <b>love</b> for God to feel deeply what sets God aside, and what is due to Himself among the people.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#199:3">Page 199</a>   If God's own people had forfeited the inheritance through lack of <b>love</b> for Him there was encouragement to believe that even a Moabite who loved Him would be graciously received.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#200:4">Page 200</a>   There is hope for <b>love</b> wherever it exists; a Moabite with <b>love</b> for Jehovah is infinitely better than an Israelite without it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#200:5">Page 200</a>   <b>Love</b> gets wondrous things now.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#200:7">Page 200</a>   The exercises of Naomi and the affections of Ruth were both found in the woman of  Luke 7:36  - 50 she "loved much"; she was not only a believer but a lover; it was <b>love</b> that brought her to the Pharisee's house and to the feet of Jesus; and how truly did she find in Him the "mighty man of wealth"!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#200:8">Page 200</a>  Orpah is a solemn warning, for she seemed to make as good a start as Ruth, but the <b>love</b> that never fails was not there, and she stopped short and went back to her people and her gods; she missed all that Ruth got.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#201:3">Page 201</a>   Are those who <b>love</b> God attractive to us?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#202:17">Page 202</a>  God would call our attention to One who holds and enjoys all that is the portion of man according to the thoughts of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#203:1">Page 203</a>   All the wealth and blessedness of what God has purposed for men as the subjects of His <b>love</b> and calling, is substantiated in Christ as the risen and glorified One, and eternally secured there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#203:9">Page 203</a>   Those who fear God, and <b>love</b> Him, and desire His blessing, find that they have a Kinsman who has the right of redemption.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#204:8">Page 204</a>   Naomi represents the moral exercises that are suitable in a day and state of departure, and <b>love</b> that desires spiritual good will never be disregardful of such exercises, but will move in accord with them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#206:2">Page 206</a>   <b>Love</b> can have everything.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#206:3">Page 206</a>   The last verse of the epistle to the Ephesians -- which is the epistle of our inheritance -- intimates to us that <b>love</b> gives access to everything.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#206:4">Page 206</a>   "Grace with all them that <b>love</b> our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#207:5">Page 207</a>   At the present day things are reached experimentally by way of <b>love</b> that seeks them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#207:24">Page 207</a>   We should covet to receive marks of the <b>love</b> and favour of Christ, so that the sense of His personal regard is in our hearts; we are not sustained altogether by what is general, but we have our personal secret with Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#207:25">Page 207</a>   The tendency is to live solely upon what is general, but <b>love</b> would not be satisfied with this; it appreciates what is general, but it has its own special delight in what is given as personal favour.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#208:4">Page 208</a>  The great thought that underlies the book of Ruth is that spiritual affections are brought into rest; satisfied <b>love</b> is the subject of the book.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#208:6">Page 208</a>   God's <b>love</b> would not be in rest if what He has given were not enjoyed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#209:17">Page 209</a>   Christ would say to us, "I <b>love</b> those that <b>love</b> me; and they that seek me early shall find me.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#210:1">Page 210</a>   I walk in the path of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment: that I may cause those that <b>love</b> me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasuries",  Proverbs 8:17  - 21.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#210:20">Page 210</a>   He will act for those who <b>love</b> Him, and secure to them all that their hearts desire, even at such a time as we are living in.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#212:6">Page 212</a>  The gate of the city would suggest a definite public witness to what Christ has become to those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#212:13">Page 212</a>   The precious thoughts of divine <b>love</b> in all their fulness could not be held by any other; in this regard Israel, and the Gentiles too, are "the dead".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#212:15">Page 212</a>   All that God has in <b>love</b> purposed for man is held by Christ in the strength of resurrection, and it becomes the portion of those who, like Ruth, come to Him, and are married to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac6.htm#213:3">Page 213</a>   It shows how <b>love</b> will reach Christ and find Him sufficient for everything -- sufficient to secure the enjoyment of the inheritance for us, sufficient to answer perfectly every affectionate desire for what is of God, sufficient, by giving us the Spirit, to constitute us suitable heirs.<br>
<h3>Volume 7 - An Outline of The Song of Songs</h3>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#1:1">Page 1</a>   It is a choice part of the Holy Scriptures, and has ever appealed to the affections of those who <b>love</b> our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#1:3">Page 1</a>   Our Lord's words are true of the present time: "Because lawlessness shall prevail, the <b>love</b> of the most shall grow cold" ( Matthew 24:12 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#1:14">Page 1</a>   And the very way in which these moral questions have been settled for those who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ has given us the knowledge of God as moving according to His own nature, that is in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#1:15">Page 1</a>   "God commends his <b>love</b> to us, in that, we being still sinners, Christ has died for us".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#1:16">Page 1</a>   There was an immense depth of need on our part, but on God's part a movement of <b>love</b> in that Christ, His beloved Son, has died for us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#1:17">Page 1</a>   In the light of this we make the wondrous discovery that God is <b>love</b>, and, that being so, He can only be satisfied with <b>love</b> on the part of His loved creature.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#1:18">Page 1</a>   God is known to us as set forth in a blessed Man, His beloved Son, who in <b>love</b> has gone into death for us, and who is now, as risen and exalted, the King of glory.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#2:2">Page 2</a>   He is seen here as manifesting His <b>love</b> to those who appreciate it, and to whom it is more precious than all else.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#2:6">Page 2</a>   No subject could be greater or sweeter than the <b>love</b> of Christ, and those responsive movements which it awakens in the hearts of those who know it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#2:7">Page 2</a>   To have the personal enjoyment of the <b>love</b> of Christ transcends all other joys.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#2:10">Page 2</a>  The <b>love</b> of Christ is a precious reality<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#3:1">Page 3</a>   The Spirit would never allow us to lose sight of His greatness and majesty -- He is the King, the supreme One, in this book -- but He would impress our hearts with a sweet and tender sense of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#3:2">Page 3</a>   He was once here in humiliation and suffering and death for us, and He has now gone on high as the exalted and glorified One; He is "the Lord of glory", but He loves each one of us with a real and personal <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#3:3">Page 3</a>   We can ask with confidence, "Who shall separate us from the <b>love</b> of Christ?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#3:10">Page 3</a>   Then Paul could say, "For the <b>love</b> of the Christ constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died; and he died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised" ( 2 Corinthians 5:14 , 15).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#3:11">Page 3</a>   As held in the embrace of the <b>love</b> of Christ we arrive at the judgment that it is due to Him that we should live to Him, not only in service but in affection.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#3:14">Page 3</a>   The theme of the "Hong" is such a consciousness of the <b>love</b> of Christ that the heart lives to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#3:15">Page 3</a>   We shall find, indeed, that there are deviations from that blessed state, which have to be the subject of movements of recovery, but the true normal state of heart, as presented in the first section of the book, is one of full and glowing response to His known <b>love</b>, and of restfulness and rapture in that <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#4:1">Page 4</a>  We all profess to have the light of the <b>love</b> of Christ, and I trust there is a real, even if feeble, sense of it in our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#4:2">Page 4</a>   Now it would be strange if we knew about the <b>love</b> of Christ, and did not desire to have some personal token of it!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#4:5">Page 4</a>   There is desire for the direct and personal expression of His <b>love</b>, some evidence of it that shall be, like the name written on the white stone ( Revelation 2:17 ), known only to the one who receives it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#4:7">Page 4</a>   It is an experience corresponding with the Lord's own words in  John 14:21 : "He that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will <b>love</b> him and will manifest myself to him".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#4:9">Page 4</a>   Such men as John and Paul knew what it was to be in nearness to Him with not a shade of reserve to cloud the consciousness of His <b>love</b>, and thousands of saints through the centuries have known it in their measure, and it is open to us to know it too.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#4:11">Page 4</a>  The tokens of His <b>love</b> are asked for on the ground that they are valued.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#4:12">Page 4</a>   "For thy <b>love</b> is better than wine".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#4:13">Page 4</a>   When His <b>love</b> is valued more than all earthly or natural joys its manifestations will be given, If that is our estimation of it we shall get "the kisses of his mouth".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#5:1">Page 5</a>   Those were farewell kisses, but the Lord's kisses are the pledge of a faithful and unchanging <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#5:7">Page 5</a>   I believe we have in the first section the <b>love</b> of Christ in its preciousness and satisfying power, as known, if we may so say, in  His  circumstances; and the affections of His own are seen as in full appreciation of, and response to, His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#5:9">Page 5</a>   The spouse is here marked by pure, unflagging, and fervent affection, and she is seen as occupying the best place which the King's <b>love</b> could give her in His own chambers and at His table.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#5:10">Page 5</a>   The affectionate relations between them are normal, and just what they should be to satisfy <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#6:8">Page 6</a>   Chapter 1 - 2: 7 is suggestive of first <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#6:9">Page 6</a>   As we know the <b>love</b> of Christ, and respond to it, and <b>love</b> one another as He has loved us, there is <b>love</b> which is fist in quality, and not merely in time; it is a quality of <b>love</b> which cannot be surpassed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#6:11">Page 6</a>  There are reasons given in verse 3 why the virgins <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#6:13">Page 6</a>   I think verse 3 is perhaps the most important verse in the book, as giving the secret of the <b>love</b> for Christ which is found in virgin hearts, that is, hearts uncorrupted by the influences of the world.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#7:4">Page 7</a>   We may admire different qualities in a friend, but it is the Person to whom they attach whom we <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#8:3">Page 8</a>   "Thy name is an ointment poured forth: therefore do the virgins <b>love</b> thee".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#8:17">Page 8</a>   If the King of  Psalm 45  and the Song of Songs were merely Man He would have no title to attract or claim the <b>love</b> of all virgin hearts, but as Emmanuel He is entitled to a <b>love</b> which would be purely idolatrous if bestowed upon a creature<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#9:1">Page 9</a>   The quality of that <b>love</b> is supremely elevated because of the greatness of the Person loved.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#10:2">Page 10</a>   "The virgins" are marked by capacity to discern the precious fragrance of Christ, and it causes them to <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#10:4">Page 10</a>   Mary of Bethany had scented it, and it called forth in response the devotion expressed by her costly ointment being put upon His feet, It indicated her appreciation of His ointments, and the <b>love</b> awakened by them in her heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#10:6">Page 10</a>   As we are preserved in simplicity as to Christ ( 2 Corinthians 11:2  - 3) we perceive that He is entitled to affections such as are due to God alone, but which He attracts to Himself by the grace and <b>love</b> revealed in Him as Man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#10:8">Page 10</a>   They shew that the Lord has pleasure in giving personal tokens of His <b>love</b>, and that His <b>love</b> is better than all earthly or natural joy.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#10:9">Page 10</a>   They also shew what a supreme claim He has to the affections of His own, and how He presents Himself in wondrous grace so as to win the <b>love</b> of virgin hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#11:3">Page 11</a>   He would bring us at once to the assembly as His guest-chamber, or, we might say, His bride-chamber, where our occupation is to be glad and rejoice in Him, and to remember (or celebrate) His <b>love</b> more than wine.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#11:4">Page 11</a>   We see here how quickly the most intimate privileges that <b>love</b> can desirer are accorded to those who are prepared to appreciate them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#11:5">Page 11</a>   Upright <b>love</b> finds a short cut to assembly privilege.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#11:6">Page 11</a>   It is said of the virgins, "They <b>love</b> thee uprightly" (verse 4).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#11:8">Page 11</a>   They are such as Paul had in his mind when he said, "Grace with all them that <b>love</b> our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption" ( Ephesians 6:24 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#11:9">Page 11</a>   To such the enjoyment of the <b>love</b> of Christ in His assembly is freely accorded, and this is the highest point contemplated in the Song.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#11:10">Page 11</a>   It may be that the experiences of many of us correspond more with what comes later in the book, but it is good to see the normal activities of <b>love</b>, and there is no divine reason why the youngest believer should not move according to them, and have the joy that is spoken of here.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#11:11">Page 11</a>   God's way would be to bring us at once under the influence of the <b>love</b> of Christ, and to keep us under that influence all the time.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#11:13">Page 11</a>   They represent lovers of Christ, for they pave His palanquin with <b>love</b> (chapter 3: 10); but they are on less intimate terms with Him, and less intelligent in the thoughts of His <b>love</b>, than is suitable to the spouse, But they are interested persons, and they are repeatedly addressed by the spouse with reference to her Beloved, and in several instances they speak to her, or about her<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#12:2">Page 12</a>   It would be a mistake to suppose that all saints <b>love</b> the Lord with equal fervour.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#12:4">Page 12</a>   Then the different figures used of the saints in the New Testament suggest different measures or qualities of <b>love</b>, The assembly is spoken of as the bride or the wife of Christ, but other figures are used which are less intimate.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#12:5">Page 12</a>   We may think of the saints as "sons of the bride-chamber", or as virgins who go forth to meet the Bridegroom, or as espoused as a chaste virgin to Christ, but the <b>love</b> which characterises those relations is not quite that of the bride or wife.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#13:7">Page 13</a>   Do I <b>love</b> much or little?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#13:8">Page 13</a>   Is the quality of my <b>love</b> that which suits the spouse, or is it such as might be found in daughters of Jerusalem?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#13:12">Page 13</a>   While we must ever bear in mind that it is God's thought to bring us to the fullest and highest quality of <b>love</b> that will minister joy to the heart of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#14:12">Page 14</a>   We should progress more rapidly if we were more responsive to the <b>love</b> of Christ in the measure in which we already know it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#15:3">Page 15</a>  The Lord is deeply concerned about the state of our affections, and the quality of our <b>love</b> for Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#15:4">Page 15</a>   One might have the <b>love</b> of a forgiven sinner ( Luke 7 ) without having affections suitable to the bride.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#15:5">Page 15</a>   The Lord knows better than we do how much we <b>love</b> Him, and He knows the quality of our <b>love</b> as well as its strength.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#15:13">Page 15</a>   Along with the sweet ministry of the <b>love</b> of Christ to our hearts there are ways of God which have the effect of reducing and humbling us in our condition here<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#17:11">Page 17</a>   The comeliness and beauty which mark the bride are the result, on one side, of the influence of the <b>love</b> of Christ, and on the other they are the effect of the disciplinary ways of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#18:10">Page 18</a>   It is surprising in one way, but it is true, that the desire to be near the Lord, and to enjoy His <b>love</b>, often calls forth bitter feeling on the part of true believers<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#19:8">Page 19</a>  It is as one disciplined by faithful <b>love</b>, and conscious, too, of diverting influences at work, that the spouse turns again to the One whom her soul loves.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#20:13">Page 20</a>   To her this would be great loss, and she felt assured that it would he a loss from which His <b>love</b> would shield her.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#21:3">Page 21</a>   She is marked off from all others by the fervour and intensity of her soul's <b>love</b> for Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#21:7">Page 21</a>   And His expressions of <b>love</b> follow upon the expression of hers.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#21:8">Page 21</a>   The <b>love</b> of Christ a s presented in this book is not a sovereign <b>love</b> which flows out of its own fulness irrespective of the condition or moral state of the object loved, but it is a discriminating <b>love</b> which is attracted by lovable features in its object.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#21:9">Page 21</a>   Such is the <b>love</b> of Christ for the assembly; He can say, "Behold thou art fair, my <b>love</b>"; "For sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely" (chapter 1: 15; 2: 14).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#22:1">Page 22</a>   There was that in her which was worthy of David's <b>love</b>; and the Spirit would indicate that the remnant typified in the spouse of the Song has features which call forth the <b>love</b> of Christ, and the assembly, too, has such features.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#22:2">Page 22</a>   One has no difficulty in seeking to apply the language of the Song to saints of the assembly, because the <b>love</b> of Christ as known by the assembly is certainly not less than His <b>love</b> as the remnant will know it, nor should our response to it be less fervent than theirs.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#22:3">Page 22</a>   And I have no doubt this book was intended by the Holy Spirit, to have special value for us, as setting forth in a striking way the affections which are proper to saints who know the <b>love</b> of Christ, and as shewing what those who have such affections are in the estimation of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#22:6">Page 22</a>   All such features are developed as we appreciate Christ and His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#22:9">Page 22</a>   He does, indeed, in faithful <b>love</b> meet the wolf, but He does so because He will have His flock not only in security but in perfect satisfaction and repose<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#23:11">Page 23</a>   If we See persons withdrawing from iniquity, separating themselves from vessels to dishonour, and pursuing righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart, we may be assured that we see some of the footsteps of the flock<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#24:13">Page 24</a>   But one thing is certain, that the footsteps of the flock are in the paths of righteousness; the flock is composed of those who <b>love</b> the Lord and keep His commandments.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#24:15">Page 24</a>   A great many people today know where there is spiritual food to be had, but for one reason or another they do not go there; this becomes really a test of <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#25:2">Page 25</a>   She has taken character from the One whom her soul loves, and is engaged in the same kind of service of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#25:3">Page 25</a>   And "the shepherds' booths" would suggest that those who <b>love</b> Him become, in their measure, shepherds also, and care for His flock.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#25:6">Page 25</a>   And this is set forth in the military figure to which He now compares His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#30:2">Page 30</a>   The assembly's "spikenard" is the holy fragrance of Christ sent forth from myriads of hearts as they apprehend and appreciate His glorious place as supreme in the administration of all that fruit of divine <b>love</b> which constitutes today the substance of the communion of saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#31:6">Page 31</a>   To see Him in relation to it, as supreme in the administration of divine wealth of blessing, awakens deep appreciation in the hearts of those who <b>love</b> Him, so that their spikenard sends forth its fragrance, as the woman's did when she broke her alabaster flask of costly nard, and poured it out upon Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#32:11">Page 32</a>   He lies in the affections of His bride, in all the fragrance of His suffering <b>love</b>, through the night of His reproach and rejection here, This represents the state of heart in which His supper would be truly appreciated.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#32:14">Page 32</a>  I am sure we need to cherish more the affectionate appreciation of a suffering Christ -- suffering as moving in a way of infinite <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#33:3">Page 33</a>   No public or administrative glory which He has, or will have, could touch and move the heart like the sorrows which His <b>love</b> has endured, and through which it has expressed itself to us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#33:7">Page 33</a>  The Lord's supper is for the remembrance of Him as the One who suffered in <b>love</b> to reach an end which could be reached in no other way.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#33:9">Page 33</a>   And His blood was poured out, His life given, that divine <b>love</b> might be known.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#33:10">Page 33</a>   His <b>love</b> to each individual saint, and to the assembly, is known by what He suffered in the devotion of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#33:11">Page 33</a>   Contemplating the greatness of the blessings He has secured, or the glory into which He has entered, does not so deeply touch the heart as to ponder the way of suffering <b>love</b> which He has traversed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#33:12">Page 33</a>   The blessings secured are infinitely great, but deeper and sweeter is the <b>love</b> that suffered to secure them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#33:13">Page 33</a>   How it will touch the hearts of the remnant of Israel, after going through accumulated and almost overwhelming sufferings themselves under the government of God, to find that their Messiah -- God's Anointed -- has identified Himself in <b>love</b> with their suffering position<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#34:1">Page 34</a>   In <b>love</b> He has borne their griefs and carried their sorrows as well as being wounded for their transgressions.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#34:2">Page 34</a>   That Emmanuel, Jehovah the Saviour, the righteous One should suffer in <b>love</b> to secure His people for blessing, and for association with Himself is most deeply touching.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#34:6">Page 34</a>   When that testimony is received, through God's gracious working in the suffering remnant, how they will <b>love</b> their long-rejected Messiah!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#34:9">Page 34</a>  But is He not known to  us  in the same fragrance of suffering <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#34:10">Page 34</a>   Do we not know and <b>love</b> Him as the "Man of sorrows"?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#34:11">Page 34</a>   Has He not for our sakes become poor, and made known the intensity of His <b>love</b> by giving His body and pouring out His precious blood for us?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#34:13">Page 34</a>   Even as to bodily infirmities He bore in His spirit the full weight of all that He removed by His power, It was part of the suffering way which His <b>love</b> took<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#35:3">Page 35</a>   She is consciously near to Him, and has a deep sense that His <b>love</b> has suffered immeasurably that He might have her there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#35:5">Page 35</a>   But He has suffered that she might have the nearest and most intimate place of association with Him, and that she might know and enjoy His <b>love</b> in that place.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#35:6">Page 35</a>  It is the privilege of the saints as they eat the Lord's supper to call Him to mind as the One who went even into death that we might know His <b>love</b> in the most intimate way.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#35:8">Page 35</a>   He went that way that He might have us for Himself, and for the pleasure of God, in the eternal nearness of known <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#35:9">Page 35</a>   The spouse has entered into this, and appreciated it, so that she can cherish the thought of His suffering <b>love</b> in relation to its own blessed thoughts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#35:11">Page 35</a>  What a comfort to the heart of Christ that the sufferings of His <b>love</b> should be cherished between our breasts all through the night of His absence and rejection here<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#36:1">Page 36</a>   Indeed, His suffering <b>love</b> will have a place throughout eternity in the hearts of the redeemed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#36:4">Page 36</a>  It is good to think of the Lord's suffering <b>love</b>, not from our side as needy sinners, but from His side in relation to all the thoughts of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#36:6">Page 36</a>   His <b>love</b> went a certain way that it might reach a certain end, and that end was that we might be in the most intimate nearness to Him in His own circumstances, if we may so say, where <b>love</b> has its unhindered flow without a thought of sins or sin to divert from Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#36:8">Page 36</a>   It was the way of His <b>love</b>, for "When Israel was a child then I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son" ( Hosea 11:1 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#36:9">Page 36</a>   But redemption for God's pleasure was through the suffering of the Lamb, It was effected by suffering <b>love</b>, that in result <b>love</b> might be restful in the full blessing of its objects.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#37:1">Page 37</a>   That was, that we should know His <b>love</b> and the <b>love</b> of God, and appreciate it, and reciprocate it, as brought into the most blessed nearness to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#37:2">Page 37</a>   I am sure the Spirit of God would lead us to that side of things as we think of Christ as a bundle of myrrh between the breasts of those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#37:4">Page 37</a>   To cherish Christ's suffering <b>love</b> would prepare us for suffering here.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#37:9">Page 37</a>   Cherishing the Lord as known in suffering <b>love</b> -- as we call Him to mind in His supper -- would prepare us to carry Him as our distinguishing ornament here.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#38:8">Page 38</a>   We have noticed before that in this book He does not express His <b>love</b> until she has expressed hers.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#38:9">Page 38</a>   It is not the gospel side of things; it is not, "We <b>love</b> because he first loved us", but rather, "I <b>love</b> them that <b>love</b> me".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#38:11">Page 38</a>   So He says here, "Behold, thou art fair, my <b>love</b>; behold, thou art fair: thine eyes are doves".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#40:11">Page 40</a>   She is conscious that there is nothing in her to disturb the restfulness of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#42:4">Page 42</a>   His <b>love</b> is known rend enjoyed, and the section closes with the expression of her desire that nothing may disturb the restfulness of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#42:9">Page 42</a>   He can rejoice over His saints, and rest -- or be silent -- in His <b>love</b> ( Zephaniah 3:17 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#42:11">Page 42</a>   He can rest in His <b>love</b>, and she can rest in His <b>love</b>, and the only thing to be guarded against is any movement that would disturb the rest of <b>love</b>, The King says little in such conditions.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#43:3">Page 43</a>   That comes in, as it would appear, to move her, to stimulate her affections into activity, that she may be drawn into concert with Him by the impelling influence of His thoughts of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#43:7">Page 43</a>  We rejoice to think of the Lord's activities, but there is something even more precious than His active <b>love</b>, and that is His restful <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#43:8">Page 43</a>   His activities are called forth very often by deficiencies or defects on our side, but the rest of His <b>love</b> is secured as things are complacent to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#45:11">Page 45</a>   But grace is in supremacy in the Person of Christ as enthroned in heaven, and there are those here who appreciate and <b>love</b> Him because they are children of Jerusalem above.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#45:14">Page 45</a>   But to be awakened in the sense of chapter 8: 5 of the Song is to have one's eyes opened to see the surpassing excellence of Christ, and to <b>love</b> Him<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#46:11">Page 46</a>   Such affections have their seat in the assembly now; we may <b>love</b> Christ with intense fervour now as they will in their day.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#46:13">Page 46</a>   I have no doubt the Spirit of God intended this book to have a profound effect upon us now, in giving us divine and spiritual impressions as to the <b>love</b> which is in the heart of Christ towards His saints, and as to their <b>love</b> for Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#46:14">Page 46</a>   Israel in the millennium will be the earthly bride ( Hosea 2:16 , 19), but before that day there will be a remnant who will know the <b>love</b> of their Messiah, and will respond to it, while He is yet publicly rejected.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#47:3">Page 47</a>   Her affections are developed under the known <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#47:4">Page 47</a>   Such affections are in the assembly today; that is to say, the work of the Spirit is to produce and maintain them, It is ours, like the remnant, to know a suffering Christ, and to <b>love</b> Him, and to "follow the Lamb wheresoever it goes".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#49:5">Page 49</a>   "The house of wine" and the banner of <b>love</b> are wonderful figures for the Spirit of God to use, but they are not exaggerated or over-drawn figures.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#49:7">Page 49</a>   And it is even conveyed to us that the conscious enjoyments of divine <b>love</b> may be so great as to be almost insupportable.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#49:8">Page 49</a>   A feeling that special support is needed to sustain us in presence of the known and enjoyed <b>love</b> of Christ is a truly spiritual feeling.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#49:9">Page 49</a>   It is possible to have such an overpowering sense of the <b>love</b> of Christ that we need to be sustained and refreshed even to bear it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#49:11">Page 49</a>   But the spouse in the Song looks for sustenance and refreshment that she may be equal to bearing the exceedingly blessed character of the <b>love</b> that embraces her.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#49:14">Page 49</a>   we are probably more often sick because we are not enjoying His <b>love</b>, like the bride in chapter 5: 8.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#50:3">Page 50</a>   No exercises present in the heart save those which are produced by a sense of the overpowering character of the <b>love</b> of Christ!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#50:6">Page 50</a>   The voice of the Beloved is known and heard, and His activities in <b>love</b> are perceived, but the spouse has not His company.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#50:8">Page 50</a>   There is <b>love</b> on both sides here, for she says, "My beloved" repeatedly, and He says, "My <b>love</b>", but they are not together.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#50:14">Page 50</a>   But He moves thus swiftly because she is not with Him, and His <b>love</b> would call her forth from where she was dwelling to move with Him in a region where all was attractive to Him, and the beauty of which He describes to her to allure her forth to join Him in it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#50:16">Page 50</a>   It sets forth the closest intimacy, and enjoyment of the <b>love</b> of Christ in ail its preciousness according to divine thoughts<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#51:2">Page 51</a>   And a great part of this most precious book is occupied in shewing how He acts and how He speaks in order to assure His loved ones of the place they have in His thoughts, that they may come into that enjoyment of His <b>love</b> which is normal.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#51:10">Page 51</a>   But behind all that there are precious activities of the <b>love</b> of Christ going on, and His voice is calling those whom He loves to come with Him into a spiritual region which is altogether beyond the cold and storms of winter<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#52:4">Page 52</a>   But this chapter intimates that the Lord will draw near to them in active <b>love</b> to call them into the joy of what has sprung forth in resurrection power in Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#52:9">Page 52</a>   They are conditions which are to be known spiritually, and which may therefore be altogether missed as to present enjoyment if the call of <b>love</b> meets with no response.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#53:1">Page 53</a>   This conveys that after passing through the sorrows and sufferings connected with His being the Sin-offering, Christ would come forth in the morning of resurrection in the activities of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#53:7">Page 53</a>   We have a place here providentially which is ordered of God, and for which we may be truly thankful, but there is a possibility of settling down in providential circumstances in such a way as to be detained from responding to the call of Christ's <b>love</b>, and moving with Him into the wide expanse of spiritual realities to which He calls us forth.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#53:8">Page 53</a>   We all have a providential house of some kind, and a shelter "in the clefts of the rock" or "in the covert of the precipice", but to be sheltered and preserved in the midst of evils here -- valuable as it is -- comes far short of what the <b>love</b> of Christ desires for us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#53:9">Page 53</a>   He would have us with Him as to the precious thoughts of divine <b>love</b> which have been secured in Himself, and He would have our countenances to be lighted up with the joy of these thoughts, and our voices heard in speaking of them to Him<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#55:7">Page 55</a>  But, though the spouse recognises that it is the voice of her Beloved that she hears, and her heart must needs own how attractive is the spring-time which He describes, she does not respond to His call of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#56:9">Page 56</a>   But she does not respond to His present call of <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#56:15">Page 56</a>   And yet, with all this, there may be a lack of preparedness to go with Him in spirit into that scene of life to which His <b>love</b> invites us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#56:18">Page 56</a>  CHAPTER 3 We may even, after such a call of <b>love</b>, go to bed as in chapter 3: 1<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#57:5">Page 57</a>   And yet, so strange and complex are the workings of the heart, there is a seeking Him even on the bed which is the evidence of how His call of <b>love</b> has been disregarded.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#57:9">Page 57</a>   But such an experience is the governmental consequence of neglecting the voice of the Beloved, and being found where His <b>love</b> would never have had us to be.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#57:13">Page 57</a>   One may manifest a considerable degree of indifference to His <b>love</b> in the way of being reluctant to move with Him, and yet there may be a desire that He should be with as in our conditions, and give us the comfort of His <b>love</b> there<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#58:2">Page 58</a>   His <b>love</b> is very sensitive, and He also considers with infinite wisdom what our <b>love</b> needs in the way of correction, that it may be purified from elements that are neither worthy of Him nor of His spouse.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#58:8">Page 58</a>   Her <b>love</b>, not being regulated by His voice and leading, and moved by its own sense of loss rather than by the constraint of His <b>love</b>, brought her into circumstances which were quite unsuitable to His spouse.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#59:3">Page 59</a>   Distance between the heart and Christ exposes itself to those who have a watchman's eye in many and obvious ways, though true <b>love</b> may be there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#59:9">Page 59</a>   It is later in the book, and following upon continued disregard of the most touching appeal of <b>love</b>, that the watchmen use severe measures.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#60:1">Page 60</a>   It is a peculiarly gracious act of His <b>love</b> when the sense of nearness, and of conscious possession of Him, is restored after being lost through lack of response to His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#60:2">Page 60</a>   It gives a deep and tender sense of the fidelity of His <b>love</b> which is enhanced by the conviction that it has not been appreciated or answered to in any right degree on our side.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#60:8">Page 60</a>   We can pass through no exercise more humbling than that which is occasioned by the discovery that we have been unresponsive to the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#60:11">Page 60</a>   But the distress of losing Him thus, the anguish of heart passed through in those dark nights when He is sought without being found, result, through the overruling of almighty divine <b>love</b>, in the development of an energy of apprehension which was not present before.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#62:3">Page 62</a>   Each of these first two sections ends with a charge that her <b>Love</b> is not to be disturbed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#62:6">Page 62</a>   That is a normal exercise of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#62:9">Page 62</a>  The lessons we learn in connection with actual failure in walk are not nearly so searching and humbling as those which arise from the inward discovery that our hearts have failed to respond to the <b>love</b> of Christ, The one is external and perhaps more public, but the other arises from the consciousness of a decline which is only known to ourselves and to the Lover of our souls.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#63:1">Page 63</a>   In addressing Ephesus in the Revelation, the Lord says, You have not failed outwardly; you are a beautiful assembly; you are preserving order, you are faithful, you are doing everything right outwardly, but you have left your first <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#63:3">Page 63</a>   I suppose we all know it well; the sorrow of feeling that our hearts are not as responsive to the <b>love</b> of Christ as they might be -- as they ought to be!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#65:2">Page 65</a>   We wan: that tenacity of <b>love</b> to hold Him and not let Him go.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#65:5">Page 65</a>  This is a very happy section of the book because there is no failure in it, all is of grace, and the thoughts of the <b>love</b> of Christ concerning His spouse come into fuller expression than before.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#65:6">Page 65</a>   His object in it all is that she may come with Him in response to His <b>love</b>, and we see a greater response here than in the section that precedes or the one that follows.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#65:9">Page 65</a>   Revival means that there has been a low state, but now there has been a lifting up, a restoration to the proper activities of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#65:16">Page 65</a>   After the most blessed revival we may come down again, and yet the Lord in His faithful <b>love</b> can use that to teach us something that we need to learn<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#68:7">Page 68</a>   We are blessed now according to the thoughts of the <b>love</b> of God, and the <b>love</b> of God has come out in the wonderful fact that Christ has died for us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#68:14">Page 68</a>   We are not only in the fragrance of the death of Christ, but we have a living Priest to lean upon who can conduct us into everything that is the fruit of divine <b>love</b> and divine purpose.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#68:16">Page 68</a>  In an atmosphere of <b>love</b> we do not dwell on what has been removed, but on all that has been brought in, and that makes an immense difference<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#69:13">Page 69</a>   The spouse, as such, does not appear in these verses, though they form a preface to wonderful utterances of the King's <b>love</b> to her in chapter 4.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#71:14">Page 71</a>   We may be sure that as the enemy tries to rob Him of His glory, the Spirit of God will ever be lifting up a standard by magnifying and increasing that glory in the estimation of those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#72:4">Page 72</a>   Its pillars he made of silver, its support of gold, its seat of purple; the midst thereof was paved with <b>love</b> by the daughters of Jerusalem".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#74:6">Page 74</a>   There are features of divine glory and <b>love</b> about the movements of Christ; they are all in keeping with the new covenant which is marked by surpassing and subsisting glory (see  2 Corinthians 3 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#74:7">Page 74</a>   If attention is called to things which are purely of God -- things which are the outcome of His <b>love</b>, and according to His purpose -- we may feel assured that the Lord is in movement.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#75:6">Page 75</a>  Then, finally, "The midst thereof was paved with <b>love</b> by the daughters of Jerusalem".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#75:8">Page 75</a>   The true "daughters of Jerusalem" find pleasure in furnishing a pavement of <b>love</b>; they anticipate what is required, like the woman who "beforehand" anointed His body for burial, or like those who went before Him and strewed their garments on the way as He entered Jerusalem as Zion's King.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#75:9">Page 75</a>   He loves to have His way prepared, and His palanquin paved with <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#76:2">Page 76</a>   Their affections made ready for His movements; the pavement of <b>love</b> was there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#76:5">Page 76</a>   Even then He will move as borne upon His people's <b>love</b>, in response to the bridal call for Him to "Come"!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#76:7">Page 76</a>   I believe the pavement of <b>love</b> has ever to be furnished, and the "daughters of Jerusalem" have the peculiar favour of being allowed to furnish it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#76:11">Page 76</a>   May it rather be that our hearts, as spiritually alert, may know how to provide the pavement of <b>love</b>, so that all is ready on our part for His next movement, whatever it may be!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#77:1">Page 77</a>   The "chariots" would speak of the alacrity of <b>love</b> on the part of a willing people, but the "palanquin" would impress upon us that to support His movements there must be a "labour of <b>love</b>" to which we have to put our shoulders.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#77:2">Page 77</a>  The Lord will move in <b>love</b> and glory amongst His people to the end, and He would have us identified with His movements, SO that in moving HC has the comfort of knowing that our affections are in accord with Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#77:4">Page 77</a>   What dignity and honour, as well as sweet privilege of <b>love</b>, does this confer upon us!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#77:6">Page 77</a>   It is good that we should provide a pavement of <b>love</b> for Him, and be ready to carry Him in all His movements.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#77:12">Page 77</a>   For the crown here is not the crown of the kingdom, not the crown of millennial glory, but the glory which attaches to Him as pledged in faithful <b>love</b> to His spouse, It is not that the marriage is consummated, but the gladness of His heart is great in being espoused to His bride<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#78:1">Page 78</a>   What a day it will be when His mother Israel understands the joy of His <b>love</b> in entering into a bond with an elect company given to Him by His Father to be His spouse!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#78:4">Page 78</a>   It may be ours in one aspect to crown Him; in another aspect to behold Him crowned; and in a third and most blessed aspect to know that we form part of that chaste virgin to whom He is espoused in changeless <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#78:10">Page 78</a>   I think we should be intensely interested not only in what may be regarded as the general blessings of divine grace, but in the specialities which <b>love</b> delights to confer.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#84:5">Page 84</a>   Even when we ourselves see souls acquiring new apprehensions of Christ, or desiring to see Him more clearly and fully, it gives us genuine pleasure, and that is the <b>love</b> of Christ in His saints leading them to appreciate what He appreciates.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#84:13">Page 84</a>   This kind of subjection is not brought about by a sense of duty, but by <b>love</b> and reverence.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#85:7">Page 85</a>   As constrained by His <b>love</b> we no longer live to ourselves but to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#87:11">Page 87</a>  Subjection to one Shepherd, as knowing and confiding in His <b>love</b>, will lead to our being found in most favourable pasture.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#93:12">Page 93</a>   And it may be ours, through grace, to give pleasure_ to Him by the way we speak, The thought of pleasing the One who loves us, and whom we <b>love</b>, might well be a mighty and perpetual influence in our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#96:2">Page 96</a>   The figurative language of the Song can only be rightly interpreted by those who are characterised by genuine and practical piety, and by true and fervent <b>love</b> for Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#97:10">Page 97</a>   It is a true assembly feature, and a part of the fairness of His spouse which makes her attractive to His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#98:2">Page 98</a>   We can understand the Lord saying to him, and to all who, even in the very smallest degree, resemble him, "Behold, thou art fair, my <b>love</b>; behold, thou art fair".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#98:7">Page 98</a>   Grace governing the heart would secure this; the one who loves God would <b>love</b> his brother also; and there would be no partialities as to the truth, no attaching ourselves to one aspect of the truth in such a way as to lose interest in the whole circle of truth.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#100:2">Page 100</a>   But whether they are formed little or much they are the only features which attract the <b>love</b> of Christ,.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#100:13">Page 100</a>  "The mountain of myrrh" speaks of the <b>love</b> of Christ as expressed in suffering even unto death<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#101:2">Page 101</a>   No blessings conferred, no glory that can be brought in, give such an impression of Christ as the contemplation of Him as suffering in His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#101:3">Page 101</a>   A suffering Messiah touches the heart of those who <b>love</b> Him in a deeper way than a glorified One.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#101:7">Page 101</a>   There is not a sorrow in the human heart which He has not made His own, and this in the willing devotion of <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#101:9">Page 101</a>   When the Passover in the upper room and Gethsemane and Calvary become to the remnant "the mountain of myrrh" how they will <b>love</b> their Messiah as known in the unparalleled suffering of His <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#102:1">Page 102</a>   We thus find ourselves in a spot where the fragrance abounds; we come to such an expression of His <b>love</b> in its greatness that it may well be spoken of as "the  mountain  of myrrh".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#102:3">Page 102</a>   He came in flesh that He might have a body in which His <b>love</b> could be expressed -- a <b>love</b> that no suffering stayed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#102:4">Page 102</a>   The flesh and blood of Christ have become the great witnesses of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#102:5">Page 102</a>   His <b>love</b> suffered all through in innumerable ways, but the climax of all was that He gave Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#102:8">Page 102</a>  If the body and blood of Christ have been given for us in <b>love</b> who can measure the immensity of the result?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#102:10">Page 102</a>   If we want to understand the character of present blessing we must pass over into the great thoughts of divine <b>love</b>, we must think of what God has purposed, of what the Father would have for His own pleasure.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#102:12">Page 102</a>   If we eat the Lord's supper in true self-judgment we have not to think of ourselves in any other way than as the subjects of infinite <b>love</b>, and as those who are blessed according to the thoughts of that <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#103:2">Page 103</a>   He knows in full measure the value of His own death, and all its fruits, and His saints are ever on His heart as those who have their place and portion according to the thoughts of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#103:5">Page 103</a>   He must think of them according to the lofty thoughts of His own and the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#103:9">Page 103</a>   As Head He would delight to bring us into all that is in His heart Godward in priestly and intercessory <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#103:10">Page 103</a>   "The mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense" set forth in a figurative way the elevation which our souls may reach spiritually as we contemplate the <b>love</b> of Christ as expressed in death, and as expressed in the precious and holy thoughts of His heart told out to God and the Father.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#103:13">Page 103</a>   Divine <b>love</b> known, its precious thoughts unfolded, and all seen as secured eternally through the suffering <b>love</b> of Christ, and as now cherished in His heart for us<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#104:6">Page 104</a>   "Thou art all fair, my <b>love</b>; and there is no spot in thee".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#104:11">Page 104</a>   His twice-repeated "with me" shows how His <b>love</b> would have us to move and to look at things as He moves and as He looks at them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#104:13">Page 104</a>   All is the fruit of the <b>love</b> in which He suffered and gave Himself for us, and hence it is supreme blessedness according to the height of God's thoughts<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#105:4">Page 105</a>   There is no assumption in talking up the place which divine grace and <b>love</b> has given us; it is the truest humility to do so, and it glorifies God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#105:12">Page 105</a>   May our hearts truly respond to the <b>love</b> in which He says, "Come with me"!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#105:15">Page 105</a>   It should never be to our hearts a repetition of past privileges; we should look for a new impression of Christ and of divine <b>love</b> each time.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#106:1">Page 106</a>   Such is the greatness of Christ, and of His fragrant <b>love</b> disclosed in death, that there is always more to know and to treasure in our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#106:2">Page 106</a>   Thus shall we be more and more prepared to give place to Him as Head, and to move  with Him  in the high region of divine thoughts and the purposes of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#106:3">Page 106</a>  "The lions' dens" and "the mountains of the leopards" are brought in at this point, I believe, to shew that the high and precious thoughts of divine <b>love</b> have their place even in presence of malignant powers of evil.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#106:9">Page 106</a>   The concentrated power of evil will be unable to countervail the working of divine power in infinite grace and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#107:1">Page 107</a>   But in spite of all this there are on earth those who have features of bridal beauty, those who know and appreciate the <b>love</b> of Christ, and who respond to Him in holy affections.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#107:7">Page 107</a>   As spiritual development proceeds there is an enlargement of that in which the <b>love</b> of Christ can be complacent.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#107:8">Page 107</a>   It should be a concern with us to yield Him increasing pleasure, that His <b>love</b> may be more and more drawn out to us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#107:10">Page 107</a>   We shall be formed by grace in the appreciation of Christ, and in response to Him, and it will be suitable for Him to convey to us the expression of His <b>love</b> in a more intense way.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#108:1">Page 108</a>   This is the language of fervent <b>love</b>, but it is not exaggerated; it does but express the true affections of Christ that are called forth as He sees the work of God taking form in His saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#109:16">Page 109</a>   We may say, surely, that the Lord could not do otherwise than <b>love</b> such features.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#110:8">Page 110</a>  Then He says further, "How fair is thy <b>love</b>, my sister, my spouse!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#110:9">Page 110</a>   How much better is thy <b>love</b> than wine!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#110:12">Page 110</a>   I take this to mean that they come to Him in affection; He becomes attractive to their hearts; there is <b>love</b> there in which He can delight, for it was the Father who put it there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#111:5">Page 111</a>   And the <b>love</b> which is attracted to Him, and which appreciates Him and finds Him to be very precious, is "fair" to Him, and "much better .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#111:9">Page 111</a>  The spouse had said in chapter 1: 2 that His <b>love</b> was better than wine, but He says of her <b>love</b> that it is "much better .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#111:13">Page 111</a>   In the light of this we are led to see that Christ appreciates the <b>love</b> of His saints more than they appreciate His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#111:16">Page 111</a>   The Beloved will be pre-eminent in <b>love</b> as in all else; He will ever exceed in <b>love</b> to His saints, to His assembly, any <b>love</b>, however true, which they have for Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#114:16">Page 114</a>   They do not attract His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#115:6">Page 115</a>   He speaks of them to us that WC may come more and more into correspondence with the thoughts of His <b>love</b> concerning us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#116:16">Page 116</a>   That is a great feature of her attractiveness to Him, and it is as holding ourselves reserved for Him that we answer to the pleasure of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#120:13">Page 120</a>   Labour and faithfulness and unwearied endurance are excellent things, but one may have all these and fall from first <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#121:11">Page 121</a>   And it is so with all the orderings of divine <b>love</b> for the saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#122:8">Page 122</a>   How precious it is to the Lord to come into a company where everyone has been prepared in some small measure at least, to suffer in <b>love</b> for Him!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#122:11">Page 122</a>   His honeycomb would speak of the pleasure He finds in His saints as knit together in <b>love</b>, and mutually co-operating to produce the sweet fruits of the divine nature.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#122:12">Page 122</a>   His wine and His milk indicate that He finds everything to gladden and satisfy His heart in those who are formed under the influence of divine grace and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#123:3">Page 123</a>   Whatever He receives, we may be sure that He will always be pre-eminent in <b>love</b>, and will give more than He receives.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#124:2">Page 124</a>   That which is the full fruit of grace and of the presence of the Spirit is seen in the one; an assembly fallen, as having left her first <b>love</b>, is seen in the other.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#125:4">Page 125</a>   But Ephesus had left her first <b>love</b>, and the spouse had become lethargic as to her Beloved.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#125:14">Page 125</a>  The Lord is very jealous as to the place He would have with us; His <b>love</b> cannot suffer us to be at rest without Him<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#126:5">Page 126</a>   In such a case first <b>love</b> has been left, and the soul has entered upon a course which, if not broken in upon by the Lord in His ever faithful <b>love</b>, would lead to Laodicean self-satisfaction.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#126:17">Page 126</a>   "Open to me, my sister, my <b>love</b>, my dove, mine undefiled"<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#127:12">Page 127</a>  But when the soul has got into this dormant state of self-consideration and self-complacency the Lord will raise the question of His own rights in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#127:13">Page 127</a>   His <b>love</b> is sensitive: He feels it if we can be comfortable without Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#128:2">Page 128</a>   But His hand being put in by the hole of the door is evidently a further and more direct action of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#128:4">Page 128</a>   But His hand being put in was really a partial manifestation of Himself, It made the spouse so conscious of the reality of His Person and <b>love</b>, and of His claim to her, that it produced deep feelings in her.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#129:6">Page 129</a>   Nothing could be more injurious to those who have left first <b>love</b> than to get the impression that the Lord has not felt this defection deeply.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#129:10">Page 129</a>   The fidelity of His <b>love</b> comes out as much in His withdrawing Himself in verse 6 as it had come out in His voice and His knock, and in putting in His hand "by the hole of the door".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#129:14">Page 129</a>   I suppose the myrrh in this connection might suggest a faithfulness and endurance in service such as were recognised by the Lord at Ephesus, but this did not make amends for having left first <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#131:16">Page 131</a>   that I am sick of <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#132:5">Page 132</a>   "I am sick of <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#132:13">Page 132</a>   First <b>love</b> has been left, and, apart from repentance, the lamp will be removed out of its place -- a sure sign that the light is not being maintained by the Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#132:15">Page 132</a>   Whatever the public history of the assemblies may be, the Lord's ways in <b>love</b> with His own ever tend to the spiritual quickening or restoration of those affections which are proper to the bride.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#133:3">Page 133</a>   She has charged the daughters of Jerusalem to tell Him that she is sick of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#136:3">Page 136</a>   They may be hidden or obscured, but they cannot be obliterated, and even if we have "slept" -- to our own shame -- they can be revived through the faithfulness of the <b>love</b> that first gave them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#138:17">Page 138</a>   The warm glow of a changeless and perfect <b>love</b> has come out in His life, His death, and in His untiring service on high.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#138:18">Page 138</a>   John says, "To him who loves us"; he brings the <b>love</b> of Christ into the present tense.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#139:2">Page 139</a>   He is the rallying point for the thousands who <b>love</b> God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#140:1">Page 140</a>   The thoughts of divine <b>love</b> in regard to men are held in their completeness by a Man who has taken the place of Head for us in relation to God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#140:3">Page 140</a>   He is in this place on our side, so that the true measure of all that is ours in relation to God, through His grace and <b>love</b>, is not what we hold, but what Christ holds for us as our Head.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#143:9">Page 143</a>   What <b>love</b>, what complacency, what a sense of joy in having brothers, sisters, mothers who did the will of God!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#144:6">Page 144</a>   He regards them from the standpoint of One who has refreshing and purifying influences which His <b>love</b> purposes to bring to bear upon them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#144:9">Page 144</a>   Such an aspect of His eyes comes in on account of persistent disregard of His eyes as doves, and the refusal of His purifying service of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#144:13">Page 144</a>   However she may have failed she has now returned to loyal affections, her desire is toward Him in the subjection of <b>love</b>, as in heart-appreciation of His beauty she tells out what He is in her eyes<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#145:1">Page 145</a>   She knows herself to be the object of His <b>love</b>, and in the consciousness of this she is free from self-consideration.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#145:3">Page 145</a>   His eyes only convey to her thoughts of a <b>love</b> that has with it precious suggestions of purifying.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#145:5">Page 145</a>   He will in <b>love</b> wash the feet of His own that they may be "wholly clean".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#145:7">Page 145</a>   It will be noticed that in each of these scriptures the thought of washing or purifying originates in His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#145:9">Page 145</a>   There are with Him all sanctifying and cleansing resources to bring about in those whom He loves a condition which will correspond with the thoughts of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#145:12">Page 145</a>   He conveys to them that, His <b>love</b> will be active to remove every spot and soil.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#145:13">Page 145</a>   He looks at them, not only in the light of what His death has effected, but in the light of His own service of <b>love</b>; it ever enters into His thought for them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#146:2">Page 146</a>   Here the spouse has understood how He views her: she has read gentleness in His eyes, combined with a suggestion of refreshment and cleansing which in the light of the New Testament we can interpret as entering into the outlook of His <b>love</b> upon us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#146:3">Page 146</a>  Subjection to His service of <b>love</b> is needed on our part if we are to get the good of it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#146:14">Page 146</a>   With Christ in view there is deeper self-judgment, but there is detachment from the self that is judged, and true spiritual elevation, His eyes being "fitly set" intimates that He ever looks upon His saints from the standpoint of divine <b>love</b>, and of divine purpose and working, therefore there is nothing uncertain or changeable in His view<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#147:2">Page 147</a>   In John's Gospel particularly He ever speaks of His own as the subjects of unchanging <b>love</b> -- divinely quickened and divinely drawn to Him and eternally held by the Father's hand and His own hand.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#148:2">Page 148</a>   We know that those blessed cheeks -- so often wet with tears of pity and of <b>love</b> -- were actually smitten; they were once covered with the treacherous kisses of Judas.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#148:5">Page 148</a>   They had nationally esteemed Him "stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted", but when they learn that He was their Messiah, yea, their Jehovah Himself, and that His visage was so marred more than any man because of the way that His <b>love</b> was taking for them, how deeply will their hearts be moved!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#148:9">Page 148</a>   It is a great part of the beauty of Christ in the eyes of those who <b>love</b> Him that in lowly grace He has been despised and rejected of men.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#150:10">Page 150</a>   The real meaning and value of all His words of grace would be lost if they were disconnected in our thoughts from the <b>love</b> in which He suffered and died for us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#150:13">Page 150</a>  One cannot but feel that the  words  of our Lord should be very specially treasured by those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#158:3">Page 158</a>  Compassion is the way that <b>love</b> expresses itself when there is no deserving on the part of its object.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#158:4">Page 158</a>   Nothing could be more undeserving than to be "dead in offences", but the riches of mercy and God's great <b>love</b> reached us when we were such.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#158:13">Page 158</a>   So that even if things are not as they should be there are the yearnings of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#160:8">Page 160</a>   It expresses the whole excellence and elevation of His aspect as it can be surveyed by the eye of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#162:11">Page 162</a>   And those who <b>love</b> Him are well assured that the words that were put in His mouth were very sweet to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#163:3">Page 163</a>   He had been with God from eternity, and ever was God, but He came down from heaven to be Man here, the only-begotten Son in the bosom of the Father, that there might be a Man to whom God could communicate all that was in His heart and mind for men to know concerning Himself and His thoughts of grace and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#164:12">Page 164</a>   What intimacy and nearness characterise the communications of <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#165:8">Page 165</a>   Intimate nearness to the Father on one side, and intimate nearness to men on the other, combine to make His mediatorial glory wondrous in the eyes of those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#165:15">Page 165</a>   We have so much in common with those who are in the place of the spouse -- as knowing the <b>love</b> of Christ and responding to it -- that we can most profitably identify ourselves with the precious utterances of affection in which she expresses her delight in her Beloved<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#169:12">Page 169</a>   It should be a continual exercise to us to come together in normal state and conditions, so that there is not only a little for the Lord, but full pleasure for His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#172:3">Page 172</a>   But what shall we say, or think, of the sovereign <b>love</b> that has called us to be of that assembly which is nearest and dearest to the heart of Christ?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#175:16">Page 175</a>   If saints truly <b>love</b> Him, and are "willing", there are chariots for Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#176:2">Page 176</a>   He looks for a "willing" people prepared to move in <b>love</b> for Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#176:3">Page 176</a>   Wherever He finds such preparedness His soul moves Him to ride on the chariots that <b>love</b> has provided for Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#176:9">Page 176</a>   But their coming to present fruition depends on <b>love</b> and willingness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#176:10">Page 176</a>   It is <b>love</b> that welcomes the Lord, and furnishes Him with chariots.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#188:7">Page 188</a>   "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me; but he that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will <b>love</b> him and will manifest myself to him".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#188:9">Page 188</a>   He can say, "How fair and how pleasant art thou, my <b>love</b>, in delights!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#188:10">Page 188</a>  " His spouse now yields Him all the delights that His <b>love</b> can desire.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#188:16">Page 188</a>   Stature is the result of formation in the divine nature; we are as big as we <b>love</b> and no more.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#190:12">Page 190</a>   This is the climax of the present possibilities of <b>love</b>: it is as near to the consciousness of union as anything which we find in this precious book, which is so dedicated to the portrayal in a figurative way of holy and spiritual affections.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#191:10">Page 191</a>   Her <b>love</b> comes out in this.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#193:2">Page 193</a>  Verse 12 gives the outlook of the spouse when she is in the conscious enjoyment of the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#195:3">Page 195</a>   Though access to the holiest may be known individually, and assembly privilege enjoyed collectively in a sweet sense of the Lord's presence and <b>love</b>, we have to return to the exercises of the wilderness life.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#195:7">Page 195</a>   And there always remain with us exercises as to the state of our hearts; not always, perhaps, exercises of conscience as to wrong-doing, but exercises of affection as to whether we are answering loyally to the <b>love</b> of Christ, and yielding Him all that His <b>love</b> desires.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#196:6">Page 196</a>   I do not think this is an uncommon exercise in regard to the liberty which <b>love</b> would desire to enjoy.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#197:6">Page 197</a>   I believe it is by returning to a sense that our title to be free in the liberty of <b>love</b> lies purely in the grace and calling of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#197:12">Page 197</a>   Now the loss of liberty always implies some departure from the sense of grace, and of the sovereignty of the <b>love</b> that has blessed us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#198:4">Page 198</a>   We appropriate Christ, and are free to <b>love</b> Him and to enjoy His <b>love</b>, not as being able to establish any title in ourselves but as being brought into being by pure grace.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#199:6">Page 199</a>   She would minister to His pleasure and be consciously in His embrace, and she would desire that nothing should disturb the restfulness of his <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#199:12">Page 199</a>   We need a living Person with divine ability to succour and sustain us, and whose <b>love</b> makes Him willing that we should lean wholly upon Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#200:10">Page 200</a>   By the support of Christ we can come up from all the exercises of the wilderness to know our place according to divine calling, and according to the purpose of infinite <b>love</b> that chose us in Christ before the world's foundation.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#201:7">Page 201</a>   Whatever knowledge of God and of Christ we have acquired as subjects of the ways of God in wilderness conditions will blend eternally with what we enjoy as the fruit of His purposes of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#202:11">Page 202</a>  The legal system could never bring forth the spouse; it could not minister the <b>love</b> of Christ, nor could it, form affections responsive in liberty to Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#203:10">Page 203</a>   The knowledge of what God bestows in grace and <b>love</b> is the basis in our souls of the affections which characterise the spouse.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#204:14">Page 204</a>   How happy it is, and how glorifying to God, to know that He has brought in every blessing for us from His own side in the free and sovereign action of His <b>love</b>, and He has secured it all in Christ, and now we are divinely awakened to see it, and to praise Him for it!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#204:15">Page 204</a>  When this liberty is known the heart is free to engage itself with the <b>love</b> of Christ, and verses 6, 7, develop the appreciation of that <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#205:2">Page 205</a>   Nothing could be more destructive of all true Christian affection than any degree of uncertainty as to our place in the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#205:3">Page 205</a>   A seal upon His heart and arm is a permanent pledge of <b>love</b> and service, and nothing less than this will satisfy the spouse.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#205:5">Page 205</a>   If all the relations between Him and His loved ones began on His side, as they surely did, they must subsist and be maintained in the faithfulness of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#205:7">Page 205</a>   And nothing can separate us from the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#205:10">Page 205</a>   She counts upon the fidelity of His <b>love</b> to do this, as knowing that His <b>love</b> has already met all the power of death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#205:11">Page 205</a>   "For <b>love</b> is strong as death".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#205:12">Page 205</a>   "No one has greater <b>love</b> than this, that one should lay down his life for his friends".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#205:14">Page 205</a>   His <b>love</b> is of such a character that it would go through everything, even death itself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#205:15">Page 205</a>   He will never cease to <b>love</b> us and serve us; our names are upon His heart and on His shoulder even as the names of the tribes were in the breast-plate and on the shoulders of the high priest<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#206:3">Page 206</a>   Nothing can ever remove the saints from their permanent place as objects of the <b>love</b> and service of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#206:5">Page 206</a>  "<b>Love</b> is strong as death" would, I think, set forth how firmly He holds His loved ones.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#206:7">Page 206</a>   And the <b>love</b> of Christ will never relax its hold upon those whom the Father has given to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#206:10">Page 206</a>   Such is the intensity of His <b>love</b> that any thought of a rival which would steal our hearts away from Him is intolerable to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#206:13">Page 206</a>   His exhortations, warnings, convictings, and discipline all express the jealousy of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#206:16">Page 206</a>   But there is ever behind all the divine ways, however searching and severe they may be, the burning power of an unquenchable <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#206:17">Page 206</a>   That <b>love</b> is against all the influences that tend to divert us; it ever acts to consume and destroy them; but this is to liberate us from their power, that we may enjoy, and respond to, the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#206:18">Page 206</a>  "Many waters cannot quench <b>love</b>, neither do the -- floods drown it"<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#207:1">Page 207</a>   Divine <b>love</b> is superior to the most adverse influences.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#207:4">Page 207</a>   Even in the Lord's loved disciples when He was here there was unbelief, self-seeking, and self-confidence, but His <b>love</b> burned on; it could not be quenched.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#207:5">Page 207</a>   There has been much in every one of us that would have quenched any other <b>love</b> but His.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#207:8">Page 207</a>  We need to think much of the intensely personal character of the <b>love</b> of the Son of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#207:9">Page 207</a>   No giving of substance could really either express or procure <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#207:10">Page 207</a>   "Even if a man gave all the substance of his house for <b>love</b>, it would utterly be contemned".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#207:14">Page 207</a>   "Hereby we have known <b>love</b>, because he has laid down his life for us" ( 1 John 3:16 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#208:1">Page 208</a>   Anything short of this would have been inadequate to express His <b>love</b>, or to procure <b>love</b> for Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#208:2">Page 208</a>   As we realise that we are thus personally loved by the Son of God, we must <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#208:4">Page 208</a>   If we retired more into the contemplation of His personal <b>love</b> to us, and the self-sacrifice to which it moved Him, it would have a marvellous effect upon us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#215:12">Page 215</a>   Here we see <b>love</b> equal to responsibility -- a truly happy state of things!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#215:13">Page 215</a>   If our hearts know how to take up all that appeals to affection in this wonderful part of Scripture we shall become witnesses to the fact that <b>love</b> is very practical<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#216:1">Page 216</a>   <b>Love</b> alone will yield in the place of responsibility all that is due, but will yield it not simply because it is due, but because of the pleasure <b>love</b> finds in yielding it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#216:3">Page 216</a>   Affection dedicates to Him a full return, so that He can receive it, not merely as being due, but as being gladly and freely accorded to Him by the <b>love</b> of His spouse.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#216:17">Page 216</a>   But in verse 12 it is what the spouse dedicates in <b>love</b>, and its being enlarged herself she can enter into the largeness of divine thoughts even as to recompense<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#217:7">Page 217</a>   That is important, as being His final word to the object of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#217:9">Page 217</a>   It is a final word to remind His spouse that her chief concern should be to speak to HIM in accents of personal <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac7.htm#217:13">Page 217</a>   He would like to have an expression of <b>love</b> from us that is purely for Himself.<br>
<h3>Volume 8 - Outline of the Minor Prophets</h3>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#1:19">Page 1</a>   There was in Jehovah the <b>love</b> of a true Husband; see chapter 3: 1<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#2:8">Page 2</a>   None of us would think of asking the Lord to <b>love</b> us more than He does.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#2:9">Page 2</a>   Think of all that He did in self-sacrificing <b>love</b> when He gave Himself for us!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#2:10">Page 2</a>   Think of all His services in <b>love</b>, Saviour, Intercessor, Advocate, Priest and Head!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#2:15">Page 2</a>   That there should be such a remnant is the fruit of sovereign <b>love</b> that has wrought from the divine side for the satisfaction of divine Persons.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#2:19">Page 2</a>   At the present time there are those who <b>love</b> our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#2:22">Page 2</a>   Conscious weakness casts us all the more upon divine faithfulness, upon the <b>love</b> of Christ and of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#2:23">Page 2</a>   As kept in a sense of divine <b>love</b> we shall not be unfaithful in our affections.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#2:24">Page 2</a>   The way of deliverance is to know our own nothingness as being kept near to divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#4:4">Page 4</a>   It corresponds with  Jeremiah 2:2 , "I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the <b>love</b> of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land not sown".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#4:5">Page 4</a>   The divine allurements are very wonderful; God proposes to be known, not merely as the merciful Benefactor of His people, but as coveting their affection in a most intimate and personal way, so that His <b>love</b> may be more attractive and satisfying than the whole realm of created things.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#4:7">Page 4</a>   Under the divine alluring she comes apart from all that to be satisfied with Jehovah alone, and the communications of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#4:10">Page 4</a>   If, in response to the divine alluring, we are content to have our portion in the <b>love</b> of God, He will give us all that is in the purpose of that <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#4:16">Page 4</a>   This is a true  door of hope ; it opens up to us all that <b>love</b> is so ready to give; and the result is that "she shall sing there as in the days of her youth and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#4:17">Page 4</a>   The singing here is an answer or response (see margin of New Translation) to the known <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#5:3">Page 5</a>   The <b>love</b> of Christ is known as claiming us to live to Him, and this claim <b>love</b> recognises and yields to.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#5:4">Page 5</a>   It is, indeed, a matter of righteousness as well as <b>love</b> that we should live to Him and not to ourselves, for we are not our own; we have been bought with a price.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#5:19">Page 5</a>   There is thus a present Jizreel, a present result of God's sowing, but it is found in those who have come into affectionate relation with Christ, "whom having not seen ye <b>love</b>, on whom though now not looking, but believing, ye exult with joy unspeakable and filled with the glory",  1 Peter 1:8 <br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#6:3">Page 6</a>  CHAPTER 3 The prophet was told to <b>love</b> "an adulteress, according to the <b>love</b> of Jehovah for the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods, and <b>love</b> raisin-cakes".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#6:4">Page 6</a>   That God should <b>love</b> a people in spite of the greatest unfaithfulness on their part is truly marvellous, and the thought of it bows the heart in wonder and worship.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#6:5">Page 6</a>   It is very necessary that we should know this character of divine <b>love</b>; a <b>love</b> which has its source and fountain in the very heart of God because of what He is, and which cannot be quenched or stayed by any unworthiness on the part of the creature.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#6:8">Page 6</a>   All the service of the prophets whom Jehovah sent carried with it the testimony that He still loved them, and desired their <b>love</b>, and when He came as Immanuel into their midst it was that this might be known in the most unmistakable way.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#6:10">Page 6</a>  " By the last of the Old Testament prophets Jehovah said, "I have loved you" ( Malachi 1:2 ); and to the last phase of unfaithfulness in the assemblies the Lord says, "I rebuke and discipline as many as I <b>love</b>; be zealous therefore and repent".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#6:13">Page 6</a>   In spite of all departure and unfaithfulness, though the loved one is an adulteress, the <b>love</b> remains.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#6:14">Page 6</a>  <b>Love</b> has established its title to the unfaithful one by purchase (verse 2), and this title holds good even if the claim is not answered to.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#7:2">Page 7</a>   He has established His title in <b>love</b>, and "at the end of the days" (verse 5) "shall the children of Israel return, and seek Jehovah their God, and David their king; and shall turn with fear toward Jehovah and toward his goodness".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#7:4">Page 7</a>   The two thousand years that have elapsed have not changed Him, and when they turn to Him "at the end of the days" they will find that the <b>love</b> in which He died for them remains undiminished.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#7:5">Page 7</a>  All in the Christian profession have been "bought with a price"; we are not our own; but it is a price which <b>love</b> has paid.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#7:8">Page 7</a>   But as it was with Israel so has it been in Christianity; there have been "many days" during which the claim of divine <b>love</b> has been disregarded, with the result that God's people have been deprived of all that is suitable to their ordering before Him, and they have not had even the miserable comfort which deceived hearts might have found in pure idolatry.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#7:9">Page 7</a>   Without divine <b>love</b> being known and responded to there is really nothing.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#7:10">Page 7</a>   No "teraphim" can be a substitute for God, and all who turn away from the <b>love</b> of God will find that they have nothing which they can put in its place.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#7:13">Page 7</a>  But the husband <b>love</b> of Jehovah for Israel has in view their return to Him "at the end of the days", and I believe the <b>love</b> of Christ has cherished this thought in regard of the assembly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#7:14">Page 7</a>   All believers have some idea that the assembly will be the bride, the Lamb's wife, in a future day, and that in the glorified conditions she will know His <b>love</b>, and respond to it in a way that will satisfy His heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#10:11">Page 10</a>   Let us not stop short of this; let us "follow on" to the full blessed thought of divine <b>love</b> -- to know that the ascended One claims us as His brethren, to be with Him before the Father's face in unclouded and eternal acceptance and relationship.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#10:17">Page 10</a>   This is what we are to  follow on  to know by divine grace and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#10:19">Page 10</a>  CHAPTER 11 To read this prophecy rightly we must keep in mind that the background of it all is the <b>love</b> of Jehovah for His people.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#10:20">Page 10</a>   That <b>love</b> found touching expression in the pathetic and sorrowful utterances of this book with regard to His unfaithful people.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#11:9">Page 11</a>   And God feels it as intensely today as He did then because it is all the result of turning away from His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#11:16">Page 11</a>   He was acting in <b>love</b>, but they did not recognise it; they were even openly idolatrous.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#11:17">Page 11</a>   Still in spite of all that, He did not cease to <b>love</b> them, and He provided a faithful witness of His <b>love</b> in His servant Moses.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#12:1">Page 12</a>  All this had its part in, "I drew them with bands of a man, with cords of <b>love</b>", chapter 11: 4.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#12:2">Page 12</a>   God was pleased to have a man who was nearer to Him than any prophet (see  Numbers 12:6  - 8), that His people might be drawn into the thoughts of His <b>love</b> as known by and expressed in that man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#12:3">Page 12</a>   Of course, it was Christ who was set forth, for it is by Him that God draws in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#12:4">Page 12</a>   The greatest wonder of all is that Jehovah has become Man that He might be near to men in His <b>love</b>, telling out what is in His own heart, not only by doing good and healing all that were oppressed by the devil, but by taking upon His own spirit the full weight of everything that pressed upon man by reason of sin, finally becoming a sacrifice for sin, and bearing our sins in His own body on the tree, and tasting death for us so that the reality and depth of the <b>love</b> of God to men might be manifested and known.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#12:5">Page 12</a>   God in this way is drawing men "with bands of a man, with cords of <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#12:6">Page 12</a>   It is His pleasure to be known by men as acting for them in this wondrous way of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#12:7">Page 12</a>   The One who died upon the cross is now the living Mediator of the <b>love</b> of God to men, and He is ever serving in <b>love</b> as interceding on high.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#12:8">Page 12</a>   In Him as the glorified One are perfectly set forth the place and acceptance in which the <b>love</b> of God would have men to be before His face.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#12:9">Page 12</a>   Man is in heaven in the most blessed acceptance with God, and the great proposal of the glad tidings is that through the <b>love</b> of God men may have Christ as their righteousness, and be accepted in Him the Beloved.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#12:10">Page 12</a>   By the bands of that blessed glorified Man God is drawing men into the knowledge of Himself as revealed in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#12:11">Page 12</a>   All the past and present unfaithfulness of the church has not altered the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#12:14">Page 12</a>   Christ is not repelling but attracting, and the fact that He speaks of "bands" and "cords" shows that He intends to bind men firmly to Him as the One in whom the <b>love</b> of God is expressed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#12:15">Page 12</a>   That <b>love</b> cannot be found anywhere else, but its fulness can be found there: "the <b>love</b> of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#12:17">Page 12</a>   If we respond to the drawing, the <b>love</b> that draws undertakes everything for us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#12:18">Page 12</a>   God knows everything that there is on our side, and on the side of an unfaithful church, but He says, 'I am drawing you by the Man in whom I have revealed My <b>love</b> so that you may find out that everything on your side is an opportunity for My <b>love</b>'<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#13:1">Page 13</a>   It was always so really, whether it was a naked sinner in Eden, or toiling slaves in Egypt, or idolatrous Israel, or self-righteous Jews, or poor Gentiles without God in the world; God made Himself known as acting in <b>love</b> so that the ruined creature might turn to Him in that blessed character, and be blessed in knowing Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#13:2">Page 13</a>   And now the whole truth of what God is for man has come out in the Man of His delight, the Son of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#13:5">Page 13</a>  But then we need to know the <b>love</b> of God not only in its attractiveness, but in its liberating power.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#13:6">Page 13</a>   Naturally we find ourselves unable to appropriate the blessed things which divine <b>love</b> has provided for us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#13:16">Page 13</a>   It is all to be fed upon, and God in His <b>love</b> would "gently" cause us to eat this wondrous spiritual food; we do so by the blessed liberating action of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#13:18">Page 13</a>   For what goes out of God's mouth will, in some way or other, speak of His <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#14:1">Page 14</a>   Even if it is rebuke or correction, <b>love</b> is behind it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#14:2">Page 14</a>   In the gospels every word speaks of divine <b>love</b>, and so in the epistles.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#14:3">Page 14</a>   Satan does not care what we go on with, what we feed on, if he can divert us from feeding on the <b>love</b> of divine Persons, but we can have as much of that <b>love</b> as we want.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#15:22">Page 15</a>   Why should any of us allow idols to keep us away from the house of God where He is willing to speak with us, and to bring us into the blessedness of the revelation of Himself in <b>love</b>?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#16:14">Page 16</a>   The place and relationship in which they are set corresponds with the Name which has been made known to them, and all is of infinite grace and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#17:10">Page 17</a>   All the God-sent prophets laboured for this, and yet the service of <b>love</b> was unrequited.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#17:19">Page 17</a>   Whatever He does for us individually will ultimately work out in His having the assembly for the satisfaction of His <b>love</b>, and in responsive affection to Him as His wife.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#18:5">Page 18</a>   Sonship Godward and wifely faithfulness and affection Christward are two of the most precious and affecting thoughts of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#18:7">Page 18</a>   But as it was with Israel, so has it been with the assembly: the great thoughts of divine <b>love</b> have been departed from.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#18:20">Page 18</a>  At the beginning of our dispensation the Father was revealed in the Son, redemption was wrought by divine <b>love</b> through the death and blood-shedding of Christ, so that believers might have a wholly new place before God as in Christ, and the Holy Spirit might be given to them, and they might be in the place of sons for God's delight<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#20:4">Page 20</a>   The father covering him with kisses is the New Testament equivalent to "I will <b>love</b> them freely".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#20:18">Page 20</a>   The epistle to the Ephesians describes our "Lebanon"; it is well that we should be "rooted and founded in <b>love</b>" according to that epistle, and that we should take on the smell of that heavenly region.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#21:19">Page 21</a>   Wifely affections towards Christ are liberated, and the sons of God are happy in the place His <b>love</b> has given them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#24:8">Page 24</a>   To put it in one word, the principle of hatred is going to disappear from God's moral universe and the principle of <b>love</b> is going to take its place.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#24:14">Page 24</a>   hateful and hating one another", and again, "But after that the kindness and <b>love</b> of God our Saviour toward man appeared, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#34:5">Page 34</a>   The Lord's commandment to His own to <b>love</b> one another implies that they would be drawn together in face of the hatred of the world.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#34:14">Page 34</a>   He would have His saints to take up together their relations with Him according to His own thoughts of grace and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#37:19">Page 37</a>   But it is certain that the assembly can only be the  pillar  of the truth, the public witness of it here, as holding it in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#39:5">Page 39</a>   The Lord makes His loved and washed ones "a kingdom" ( Revelation 1:6 ); in this aspect they are reigned over so that they may know the blessedness of subjection to infinite <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#42:3">Page 42</a>   He feeds His flock in the blessedness of His Father's name so that they may know the <b>love</b> of the Father to His Son, and know that they are loved in Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#42:14">Page 42</a>   Those whom He feeds have the abiding consciousness of this; their blessedness is in Christ and in the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#46:1">Page 46</a>   "But when the kindness and <b>love</b> to man of our Saviour God appeared, not on the principle of works which have been done in righteousness which we had done, but according to his own mercy he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, which he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; that, having been justified by his grace, we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life",  Titus 3:4  - 7.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#48:5">Page 48</a>   All that God requires of us is reduced to three simple elements; "to do justly, and to <b>love</b> goodness, and to walk humbly with thy God", verse 8.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#48:9">Page 48</a>   It has freed us from every kind of bondage or uncertainty as to the terms on which God is with us, so that in simplicity and liberty we may do what is right, and <b>love</b> goodness ( or mercy ) and walk humbly with our God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#52:21">Page 52</a>   Yet He has in <b>love</b> forgiven us, and He now gives us the privilege sometimes of forgiving others as He has also in Christ forgiven us;  Ephesians 4:32 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#53:8">Page 53</a>   God removes that barrier by forgiveness founded on a propitiation which He Himself has provided in <b>love</b>; see  1 John 4:10 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#58:18">Page 58</a>   It could not be otherwise in the estimation of faith; those who fear God and honour Him in their hearts know that He is for them and not against them, and that His correction is the correction of <b>love</b>, and for their benefit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#61:12">Page 61</a>   If men <b>love</b> darkness rather than light, after light has shone upon them, they are "already judged"; the day of judgment has already come for them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#62:10">Page 62</a>   The supreme wonder is that the One who in His righteous government passed the sentence of death upon the fallen creature has undertaken in His grace and <b>love</b> to deal with death on behalf of His poor creature.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#62:11">Page 62</a>   From the standpoint of His thoughts of <b>love</b> and blessing death has become His enemy as well as ours, and He has ridden upon His horses and chariots of salvation to meet and set aside its power.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#63:8">Page 63</a>   The death of Christ in its full power is available, though it is only by the attraction of His Person and <b>love</b> that any pass over with Him into the land.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#66:3">Page 66</a>   But "my high places" suggest an elevation where the positive thoughts of divine <b>love</b> are known and enjoyed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#66:17">Page 66</a>   He has brought the great actings of His grace and <b>love</b> in Christ in a fresh and living way before the hearts of His people.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#66:18">Page 66</a>   He had enabled many to rejoice in Himself, and in His great salvation, and in what He has brought to pass for the satisfaction of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#69:27">Page 69</a>   But there will be those who <b>love</b> His appearing<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#71:15">Page 71</a>   The Lord loves to gather His own together in the enjoyment of these things, and His <b>love</b> and His principles of acting do not change with the dispensations.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#72:7">Page 72</a>   So we see at the end of this chapter that God has to move in the sovereignty of His <b>love</b> to produce something in correspondence with Himself when there was not anything.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#84:4">Page 84</a>   It is a peculiar comfort given by God to Christ that a remnant should be brought into the truth of His headship, and should respond to His <b>love</b>, and should know their association with Him as His brethren before His Father and God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#89:3">Page 89</a>   Those who hold in faith and <b>love</b> to God's thoughts concerning Christ and the assembly will be protected by God as "a wall of fire round about".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#89:6">Page 89</a>   A few saints walking together in truth and <b>love</b> will find that God is unto them "a wall of fire round about".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#90:1">Page 90</a>   No figure could more strikingly convey how sensitive God is as to anything that touches those who <b>love</b> Him, and who enter collectively into His thoughts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#90:15">Page 90</a>   As we open our hearts to His grace and <b>love</b> made known to us in Christ, and as we take in what He has freely given to us, we become His portion, His inheritance.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#90:16">Page 90</a>   We may be quite sure that there is nothing so delightful to God as those purposes of <b>love</b> in regard to His elect which He has formed in Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#94:10">Page 94</a>   And I He has made known to us that He has chosen us in Christ "before the world's foundation, that we should be holy and blameless before him in <b>love</b>; having marked us out beforehand for adoption through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has taken us into favour in the Beloved",  Ephesians 1:4  - 6.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#95:5">Page 95</a>   God can be addressed in a way that corresponds with the great thoughts of His own <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#112:4">Page 112</a>   For example, the sins of believers have been put away, never to be remembered by God any more; and, as a result of this, Christ brings His redeemed ones to God in a priestly way; they are made nigh by His blood; they know the <b>love</b> of God, and have been reconciled to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#114:6">Page 114</a>   Do we delight to think of the sovereignty of <b>love</b> that selected us for such a place?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#114:22">Page 114</a>   The Father has translated us into the kingdom of the Son of His <b>love</b>, who is the true Solomon.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#114:26">Page 114</a>   But His rule, as we know it, is a rule of <b>love</b>; His kingdom is pervaded by <b>love</b>, for He is the Son of the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#116:11">Page 116</a>   It is probable that the root of all the departure, and consequent loss of blessing, could be traced to the weakening and giving up of those links of <b>love</b> which normally bind the brethren together.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#116:13">Page 116</a>   When the saints ceased to <b>love</b> one another as Christ loved them, they had really left their first <b>love</b> and had fallen, and needed to repent and do the first works.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#117:3">Page 117</a>   Philadelphia means "the <b>love</b> of the brethren".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#117:5">Page 117</a>   If we <b>love</b> the brethren we shall not imagine evil against them in our hearts, nor shall we speak evil of them nor do them any harm.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#117:9">Page 117</a>   It is to be noted that Paul writes to the Colossians and to the Ephesians on the ground that he had heard of their "<b>love</b> towards all the saints".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#117:11">Page 117</a>   I believe that, as the <b>love</b> of the brethren waned, they lost capacity to appreciate these two epistles.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#117:18">Page 117</a>   "The land" can only be enjoyed in the divine nature, that nature which we have as born of God, and it manifests itself in the <b>love</b> of the brethren.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#118:7">Page 118</a>   If God comes in in mercy to restore what has departed, the fruit of His work will be seen in <b>love</b> and truth and holiness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#120:3">Page 120</a>   That is, we are to speak of the truth which we know and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#122:9">Page 122</a>   But the ruling powers in Jerusalem did not discern Him; He was only discerned by faith and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#134:16">Page 134</a>   How the claims of His <b>love</b> have been disregarded!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#135:3">Page 135</a>   We began to think of His sufferings and death with appreciation of their atoning value, and with some sense of the <b>love</b> in which He gave Himself for us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#135:23">Page 135</a>   There is deep sorrow that the One who is now the Object of our <b>love</b> should have been despised and rejected, and that we have had our part in this.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#137:20">Page 137</a>    They  did not understand the full bearing of it, but  He  did, and viewing them as having Him in their hearts as the Object of faith and <b>love</b>, He could say that they were "already clean".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#140:8">Page 140</a>   He who was the Lord as well as the Teacher undertook in <b>love</b> bondman-service in washing the feet of His disciples.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#140:9">Page 140</a>   He had taken a bondman's form, and He still serves in <b>love</b> of that wondrous character.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#143:3">Page 143</a>   He had the deep sorrow of this, as having served Israel in <b>love</b>, and been Jehovah's Shepherd amongst them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#143:8">Page 143</a>   They will feel that they deserve the smiting of God, but their hearts will be deeply touched to learn that their Messiah has entered into, and felt, all that they are justly subject to; they will learn His <b>love</b> in this way.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#143:13">Page 143</a>   Jehovah's <b>love</b> and faithfulness to His Israel did not break down, nor did the Messiah fail to go through all that was needed if Israel was to be blessed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#143:16">Page 143</a>   We, like them, learn what is due to us by seeing it come upon One who bore it in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#145:19">Page 145</a>   The distinguishing mark of the faithful today is that they follow righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace, but they do this as those who "call upon the Lord out of a pure heart".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#152:5">Page 152</a>   But it is blessed to see that Jehovah in the sovereignty of His <b>love</b> undertakes to make this unsuitable man suitable: He undertakes to do it all from His own side.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#152:8">Page 152</a>   We do not find that Joshua had a single word to say; all that he was called upon to do was to submit himself to the actings of holy <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#152:9">Page 152</a>   Are  we  prepared to submit ourselves to the actings of <b>love</b>?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#152:10">Page 152</a>   They take place in such a meeting as this -- the Spirit of God touching spots of defilement here and there, perhaps as yet not even known to ourselves, but in the sovereignty of <b>love</b> God exposing things that are unsuited to priesthood.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac8.htm#152:14">Page 152</a>   There are those standing before Him who are ready to serve us, and the ministry of the Word is the effective means by which our state is brought home to us, and then a blessed activity of divine <b>love</b> comes in to deal with it so that conditions result that are suitable to God.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#7:32">Page 7</a>   He has the support of heaven behind him, he has the Father's <b>love</b> behind him filling his heart, he has the Spirit of the Son.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#8:20">Page 8</a>   He enters into the testing in the full consciousness of heaven's support, and of the Father's <b>love</b> resting upon Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#8:22">Page 8</a>   I think the support of heaven and the consciousness of sonship, the place we have in the <b>love</b> of God, are necessary to stand even the smallest test.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#22:6">Page 22</a>   The Lord was entitled to the affections of His own, and had come in to win those affections in the way of the service of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#22:9">Page 22</a>   He came in to secure those affections by the service of <b>love</b>, and He was there in the midst of Israel as the Bridegroom.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#23:3">Page 23</a>   They had no idea of any sort of claim on their side, or of establishing any title in their affection, but they were clothed with His worth and appreciated the wonderful character of the new position that had come about by His presence here in the service of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#24:12">Page 24</a>   If we are prepared to be served and to appreciate the way that divine <b>love</b> has taken in service, everything is made as easy as possible for us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#25:17">Page 25</a>   If I have a withered hand there is a remedy; and there is a remedy for whatever condition is found among the people of God: it comes in on the line of the service of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#30:11">Page 30</a>   It would work out that we would be prepared to go along with the few, to withdraw from the influences that are unclean, and go on with the few who follow righteousness, faith, <b>love</b> and peace; this is in keeping with what the Lord says here.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#47:30">Page 47</a>   I take it the fruit in this gospel would be the work of faith and the labour of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#47:31">Page 47</a>   The Thessalonians had it, "Work of faith, and labour of <b>love</b>, and enduring constancy of hope, of the Lord Jesus Christ".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#47:33">Page 47</a>   They had the true knowledge of God though they were only young converts, and that precious fruit appeared, the work of faith and labour of <b>love</b>: they started from the outset on the line of serving the living God<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#48:1">Page 48</a>   The measure of fruit in us is the measure of how we go on with the work of faith and labour of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#54:17">Page 54</a>   by the gazelles, or by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my <b>love</b>, till he please".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#54:18">Page 54</a>   She would not have Him disturbed -- that is right, it is the language of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#54:19">Page 54</a>   If we <b>love</b> and trust Him we do not want Him awaked.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#56:23">Page 56</a>   Then what is, in one sense, more dreadful; we have to be divinely awakened to find that, where there is such a blessed <b>love</b> on God's part, there is no response in our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#70:22">Page 70</a>   Do we <b>love</b> Him?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#70:32">Page 70</a>   It is an extraordinary witness of the Lord's <b>love</b> that He should come to His own walking on the water, and show Himself as One who is superior to all the power of evil.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#75:3">Page 75</a>   "If ye <b>love</b> me, keep my commandments" -- that is a test of spirituality?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#84:21">Page 84</a>  If you know Christ in the three-fold character we have had before us, you have your affections nourished, and you can say that you have found a Man you <b>love</b> better than yourself, so you cannot help following in His path.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#84:24">Page 84</a>   When you see that you say, 'I <b>love</b> Him, and He had the cross, so I will bring it into my pathway'.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#84:25">Page 84</a>   It is not that you like  it but you <b>love</b>  Him <br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#85:9">Page 85</a>   "For my sake" means that you <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#85:14">Page 85</a>   We could not follow a Person we did not <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#85:20">Page 85</a>   It is all the <b>love</b> of God manifested in Christ that touches our hearts and compels us into it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#86:6">Page 86</a>   Are we so influenced by <b>love</b> to Christ, and by desire that the gospel might be known in men's hearts that we are prepared to be diminished here?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#87:15">Page 87</a>   The power of the kingdom seems to appear in the way of purity and restoration, and also in the light of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#87:33">Page 87</a>   What has been lost publicly is purity of associations, and that being lost the light of <b>love</b> in sonship has been lost.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#88:2">Page 88</a>   We see the power of the two kingdoms: one kingdom marked by purity, restoring power, and the revelation of divine <b>love</b> as resting on the beloved Son; He is to be heard.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#88:17">Page 88</a>   It is impossible to think we can have the enjoyment of sonship, and divine affection, and <b>love</b> resting on the beloved Son, if we are not adjusted according to the purity of the kingdom.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#91:20">Page 91</a>   A child has no status in this world, a child is not reckoned much in this world, but what is it to be the object of the <b>love</b> of Jesus, to be in His embrace!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#93:16">Page 93</a>   In the dignity of sonship you can afford to be small, to be a little child and the subject of the <b>love</b> of Christ; you can get rid of the big 'I' and 'us' and are on the line of the pure oblation.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#104:30">Page 104</a>   There is an incorruptible bond on His side and the Lord looks for the uncorrupted bond on our side, so that at the end of Ephesians it speaks of "them that <b>love</b> our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#106:26">Page 106</a>   The young man was evidently able to appreciate the goodness he perceived in Christ; he had desires to inherit eternal life; he had kept the commandments which the Lord quoted to him, so he drew out the Lord's <b>love</b>; but there was a chain holding him of which he was quite unconscious until the Lord pointed it out to him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#109:1">Page 109</a>  The personal pathway of the Lord must always be of the deepest interest to those that <b>love</b> Him, and that part which comes before us in verses 32 - 45 is very touching.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#112:14">Page 112</a>   Yes, we see the deep sorrow of Paul's heart in the refusal of the service of his <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#114:13">Page 114</a>   The life of Jesus is a life of serving <b>love</b>; the youngest of us can take it up.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#114:19">Page 114</a>   I think it is, when you come to the root of it, because the life of God is <b>love</b> in activity; it is the very life of divine Persons.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#117:2">Page 117</a>   This means that His service was rejected, not His hands wounded at the cross: those hands that were unwearied in their ministry were wounded, and the service of <b>love</b> refused.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#136:29">Page 136</a>   God gives us the spirit of power and <b>love</b> and wise discretion, which is very necessary at the end of the day.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#140:7">Page 140</a>   God called Israel to sonship, but all failed in Israel, and must fail in the man who is under death, but the power of God comes in and introduces an entirely new order, and brings into effect every purpose of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#141:23">Page 141</a>   Yes, in learning the activities of God in the scene of death we begin to <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#141:33">Page 141</a>   The Lord sets forth that to <b>love</b> God with the whole heart, soul, strength and mind is the great commandment; it is the one thing God is set for, and He makes it clear that He will get it<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#143:5">Page 143</a>   The whole book of Exodus shows us that God had come in in grace and power and in the actings of His own <b>love</b> by way of redemption and deliverance in order that He might have men for Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#143:6">Page 143</a>   The great objective of the gospel is that God is seeking man's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#143:7">Page 143</a>   God begins by covering man's transgressions: there is a proverb which says, "He that covereth transgression seeketh <b>love</b>",  Proverbs 17:9 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#143:8">Page 143</a>   God is seeking <b>love</b>, we see that in the first commandment.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#143:9">Page 143</a>   All through the Old Testament we find God acting in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#143:19">Page 143</a>   What an infinite expenditure divine <b>love</b> has made!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#143:21">Page 143</a>  ' We should never forget that God has not reached His objective with any one of us until we <b>love</b> Him with all our hearts; we do not stand in the proper gain of the gospel until we do.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#143:24">Page 143</a>   All this was in order that the Spirit might be given to men so that there might be a divine spring of <b>love</b> in the heart of man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#143:25">Page 143</a>   Those who do not <b>love</b> Christ in christianity come under a curse, just as they did under the law if they did not <b>love</b> God<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#144:1">Page 144</a>   "If any one <b>love</b> not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be Anathema",  1 Corinthians 16:22 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#144:2">Page 144</a>   It is a moral necessity that the creature who does not <b>love</b> is under a moral curse.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#144:3">Page 144</a>   The designation which Paul uses in describing the saints is that they <b>love</b> God "those who <b>love</b> God, .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#144:8">Page 144</a>   It touches one to think that the blessed God should care for our <b>love</b>; it is the first thing in His thoughts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#144:12">Page 144</a>   It is a great thing when we begin to <b>love</b> Him in that character.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#144:17">Page 144</a>   If we <b>love</b> God, will that come down?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#144:23">Page 144</a>   That chapter speaks of the importance of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#144:25">Page 144</a>   "But if any one <b>love</b> God,  he  is known of him".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#145:15">Page 145</a>  It is quite possible that the whole heart should be characterised by <b>love</b> to God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#145:20">Page 145</a>   Desires are connected with the soul -- we desire to be for God in the sense of the wonderful <b>love</b> of God, the way He has moved because He wanted our affections.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#145:22">Page 145</a>   God has come to seek our <b>love</b> and to get it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#146:7">Page 146</a>   "The kindness and <b>love</b> to man of our Saviour God appeared" ( Titus 3:4 ), and He has saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#146:23">Page 146</a>  The first and second commandment go together, because if you are wholly for God you <b>love</b> your neighbour as yourself; that is, everything you possess you want your neighbour to have too.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#147:1">Page 147</a>   You <b>love</b> him as yourself, and want him to have what you have and more.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#147:23">Page 147</a>   There is a circle here where <b>love</b> is found in activity; there is the knowledge of God in <b>love</b> and of the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#148:17">Page 148</a>   We are here in a peculiar moment, the moment of Christ being at the right hand of God and His enemies here, and we have the unspeakable privilege of being wholly for the interests of God, and for those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#149:4">Page 149</a>   The Lord is not deceived by what seems large pretensions, He knows the exact amount of affection in which everything is done, and what is not done in <b>love</b> has no value in His eyes.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#153:5">Page 153</a>   If the features of Christ are seen, the natural man does not <b>love</b> them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#159:19">Page 159</a>   In her affection I think the woman had touched that; <b>love</b> makes us have quickened affections, and the Lord says, "She hath done what she could".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#160:11">Page 160</a>   When everything in Israel was marked by uncleanness, there was One who passed through it in the holy purity of divine <b>love</b>, and gave Himself in an unmeasured way for the needs of men -- that commanded the heart of the woman.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#161:30">Page 161</a>   The woman sets forth the subjective side, and there is nothing that satisfies the Lord on that side but <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#161:31">Page 161</a>   The Lord must have the <b>love</b> of those He loves so intensely Himself; He must have response, as the old monk said:  'The hart panteth after the waters,  The dying for life that departs;  The Lord in His glory for sinners,  For the <b>love</b> of rebellious hearts'.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#162:12">Page 162</a>  The Lord is showing a state of heart that would be ready to enter into the thought of His own <b>love</b>, and so be prepared for what comes out in the Supper.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#162:18">Page 162</a>   The Supper is not worth much apart from affection; it is a festival of <b>love</b>, and nothing else suits it, so the Lord raises the question, "One of you shall deliver me up".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#162:22">Page 162</a>   The Lord raises the question affectionately with them whether they were true in response to His <b>love</b>, or whether they were prepared to deliver Him up.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#165:19">Page 165</a>   In the spiritual sphere you do not find small things: if the guest-chamber is for Christ there is room for all the disciples, and you <b>love</b> to tell Him what a large room it is.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#167:36">Page 167</a>  The passover speaks of Christ in His ability to take up the whole question of sin for the glory of God, to bear the judgment of sin so that the ground is cleared from God's side, and on the people's side, too; and the <b>love</b> in which Christ bore the judgment becomes the nourishment of His people; they eat the Lamb roast with fire<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#168:3">Page 168</a>   That shows in the most touching way that what attaches to us in the flesh is of such a character that it necessitated the judgment of God, but One came in <b>love</b> under the judgment and was sacrificed for us, and the <b>love</b> in which He did it becomes the food of our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#169:5">Page 169</a>   For faith it is connected with the passover now, so that not only is the question of sin settled, God glorified about it, and divine <b>love</b> satisfied, but all the divine pleasure and delight is come to light in a Man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#171:23">Page 171</a>   The saints are to move on the line of meekness, lowliness, obedience, separation from the world and <b>love</b>; the saints are devoted to the pleasure of God -- all that is involved in eating.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#172:20">Page 172</a>   The cup is the blood of the covenant shed for many: the cup is the setting forth of the blood of Christ as a righteous ground on which God can set up relations between Himself and His people which give the greatest pleasure to His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#172:21">Page 172</a>   With the first covenant God found fault; the fault He found with it was that it did not make His <b>love</b> known to the people, and it did not put them into suitability to His <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#173:1">Page 173</a>   This covenant does both; it makes known the <b>love</b> of God and furnishes a righteous ground on which the people are suitable to His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#173:12">Page 173</a>   We may not arrive at the perfection of it in our apprehensions, but that is the character of it; God has revealed Himself in the perfection of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#173:13">Page 173</a>   He says, 'It is the great yearning of my heart to be known in my <b>love</b>, and I am going to work with you so that you may be stripped of every bit of self-confidence, self-complacency and self-satisfaction; I will empty you of everything you have ever trusted in or thought of value, and I will give you ability to appreciate the <b>love</b> in which I acted to bless you'.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#173:15">Page 173</a>   The effect of knowing this is that you cannot keep away from that <b>love</b> of God; it is a powerful attraction operating on you, your conscience is clear as heaven's unclouded day, and you can enter His courts with thanksgiving.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#173:16">Page 173</a>   There is the <b>love</b> of God known in the covenant and the attraction of the Priest -- a great Priest over the house of God -- and our calling is set forth in the Priest and maintained in the Priest, so the nearer you come to the Priest the more you are in the perfect rest and complacency of the position which the calling gives you.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#174:2">Page 174</a>  This principle of the covenant will spread out the <b>love</b> of God in its covenant action to many; it will reach every family, it is for  many .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#174:6">Page 174</a>   Every family will be characterised by the knowledge of God in <b>love</b>; what God is in His nature will be known to every family of the redeemed, and what He is in His nature will become the unalterable bond between the blessed God and all those who are brought to know Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#174:9">Page 174</a>   It would become a paramount influence and the irresistible claim of divine <b>love</b> to put us in concert with each other in the remembrance of Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#174:17">Page 174</a>   It is a very important and necessary intimation to those who <b>love</b> Him that the Lord is at the present time standing aloof from joys of an earthly character; it raises the question in our affections as to whether we would care to go on with things in which Christ has no part.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#179:17">Page 179</a>   The Lord says, "the kingdom of my Father" what a blessed place it had in Christ, everything there under the rule of the Father, and what complacency there was for the Father's <b>love</b> in that blessed One!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#180:21">Page 180</a>   It is joy of a spiritual order connected with the kingdom of God, an entirely new character of joy connected with the knowledge of God revealed in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#181:40">Page 181</a>   It is a question of the wisdom and activities of His <b>love</b>, and nothing but <b>love</b> can follow the lead of Christ -- we are all tested as to that.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#184:14">Page 184</a>   These chapters that bring out the sorrows of the Lord are most important in a practical sense because nothing will draw us after Him but the sense of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#184:15">Page 184</a>   We have to learn the reality of His <b>love</b> by the depth of the sorrow He went through.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#184:17">Page 184</a>   We do not follow Him to resurrection except by way of the sorrows of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#184:22">Page 184</a>   I am afraid that is often our condition; we fail to be observant of the sorrows of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#184:26">Page 184</a>   We all dread the way of suffering and death, but that way becomes very blessed to us when we see it is the way His <b>love</b> has taken.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#185:26">Page 185</a>   We see the infinite cost in His prayer; it shows the intensity of the sorrow of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#186:8">Page 186</a>   We can watch and take account of the scene, of the sensibilities of the holy Sufferer and the sorrows of His <b>love</b>, and find Him endeared to our hearts in such a way that we can be drawn after Him right through the sorrow to a scene of cloudless joy.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#186:21">Page 186</a>   And He took them to the garden, that they might learn to go behind the scenes, and learn the sorrow and the expense at which His <b>love</b> could meet death and bring in the kingdom glory<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#187:11">Page 187</a>   His glories appear and the greatness of His strength in which He travels in judgment -- they are just as real as the deep sorrows of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#187:13">Page 187</a>   Those who do it now are touched by the sorrows of His <b>love</b>, but those not melted in that way will have to be crushed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#187:15">Page 187</a>   Everything that is true joy and spiritual power comes by the sorrow of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#189:9">Page 189</a>   There is a devotion prepared to honour Christ at personal cost; they brought the aromatic spices, there was <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#197:9">Page 197</a>   It is evident that this implies recovery to that which was from the beginning, so that it speaks of true assembly conditions being found at the end so that Philadelphia becomes the subject of Christ's complacent <b>love</b> and commendation.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#198:7">Page 198</a>   I have no doubt that this, apprehended either intelligently or intuitively, led many saints to cry to God to favour His people, and to move in restoring mercy so that a remnant might be recovered to the divine centre, and that the truth of the house of God and of the service of God might be set up again in the faith and <b>love</b> of His people after being desolate in any spiritual sense for many centuries.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#201:1">Page 201</a>   There are great spiritual realities existent today which are to be recognised by faith and <b>love</b>, and as they are recognised the people of God move away from captivity into liberty.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#201:11">Page 201</a>   And the children of God who are happy in His <b>love</b> and favour cannot feel that language which expresses the experience of distance and unsuitability to God is fitting for them to use.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#201:14">Page 201</a>   The divine nature finds its liberty in conditions of holiness, truth, <b>love</b>, divine order and spirituality.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#205:10">Page 205</a>   If we have Jerusalem and the house before us we shall find that there are others who think of these things, and who <b>love</b> them, and desire to follow them up as much as we do.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#205:15">Page 205</a>   There can be no liberty to carry on the service of God in these last days save as we withdraw from what is not right, and pursue righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#207:8">Page 207</a>   There is great scope for the activity of <b>love</b> in these and other matters as taken up on the principle of local responsibility.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#208:11">Page 208</a>   We prove our genealogy today by departing from iniquity, and following righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#210:3">Page 210</a>  Then our genealogy is shown amongst the brethren by our walk and ways and spirit and by serving in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#210:19">Page 210</a>   If I can bring evidence that God, as known in grace and <b>love</b>, has a great place in my heart, and my desire is that He shall be expressed here, and worshipped here, I am known in heaven as a contributor to the house of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#219:6">Page 219</a>   And all blends to celebrate what God is in His goodness and loving-kindness, and in the whole counsel of His <b>love</b> with regard to those whom He has blessed in Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#219:7">Page 219</a>  In our day where there has been a true desire to serve God according to His pleasure in His assembly He has given His saints much enlargement of heart in His great thoughts of <b>love</b>, and notes of praise have been sounded such as were not heard during long centuries of the church's history.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#223:13">Page 223</a>  But this is only a proof of spiritual decline on the part of the builders, and shows that a <b>love</b> of selfish ease makes them think more of their own comfort than of the house of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#231:14">Page 231</a>   It is given to us to <b>love</b> and pray for "all the saints", but in doing so we think of them as subjects of divine calling.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#233:4">Page 233</a>   As faith and <b>love</b> take on the work it will be found that what is needed is supplied without fail.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#234:6">Page 234</a>   There is, perhaps, a good deal to be added yet to fill out the great thought of God, and to "beautify" the house, as we read in the next chapter, but as to the great outstanding features of the house they are present to the faith and <b>love</b> of many hearts in something like completeness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#235:4">Page 235</a>   The whole scope of grace and of divine purpose enters into the matter, and God is glorified in the vast range of His actings in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#237:22">Page 237</a>   All the positive ministry which makes God better known, and which exalts His beloved Son, and which brings out the thoughts of divine <b>love</b> in regard to His saints, has brought with it increased precious material for holy service.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#252:24">Page 252</a>   In verse 8 where "<b>love</b> in the Spirit" is spoken of, it means they had never seen Paul; it is in contrast to having known him by seeing his face in the flesh.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#253:4">Page 253</a>   They had faith in Christ and <b>love</b> to the saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#253:10">Page 253</a>   It is a great thing to join the brethren in your affections; people who <b>love</b> all the saints have joined the brethren.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#253:12">Page 253</a>   "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine if ye have <b>love</b> amongst yourselves".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#253:16">Page 253</a>   How would you show your <b>love</b> for all saints?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#253:19">Page 253</a>   The apostle showed his <b>love</b> by praying for them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#253:30">Page 253</a>   Faith, hope and <b>love</b> have a great place with the saints; Christ the object of faith; the saints the object of <b>love</b>; and heaven in hope.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#255:1">Page 255</a>   One would like to get a more adequate sense of the greatness of the gospel; what it presents is infinite -- divine Persons, <b>love</b>, wisdom, power -- everything that is infinitely great and will fill eternity with its blessedness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#255:10">Page 255</a>   The Colossians had great affection for Paul because they had benefited by his ministry; a brother whose ministry has helped you, but whom you have never seen, you <b>love</b> in the Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#255:14">Page 255</a>   It is a great thing to <b>love</b> the vessels of ministry.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#255:15">Page 255</a>   The Lord puts the ministry into certain vessels, and it is a great proof of spiritual health if we <b>love</b> the vessels of spiritual ministry; it is not what the men are in themselves.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#255:18">Page 255</a>   The effect of the ministry of Christ is that faith in Christ Jesus and <b>love</b> to all the saints is brought about.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#255:22">Page 255</a>  If there is faith in Christ Jesus there will be with it <b>love</b> to all the saints; we become interested in the saints for they are of and in Christ; they are of that order of man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#255:23">Page 255</a>   'Faith in Christ Jesus and <b>love</b> to all the saints' is the starting point in connection with assembly privilege; it is a good beginning<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#260:4">Page 260</a>   I would say that in the kingdom of the Son of the Father's <b>love</b> we are free in heart because <b>love</b> pervades that kingdom.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#260:12">Page 260</a>   But the elements of darkness and bondage are eliminated from the heart in the kingdom of the Son of the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#260:15">Page 260</a>   We asked Him to engage our hearts with Himself; there is a power in the Lord to set us free for Himself and that is the power of the kingdom of the Son of the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#263:20">Page 263</a>   I think we touch the family idea here: "See what <b>love</b> the Father has given to us that we should be called the children of God".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#263:21">Page 263</a>   It is a question of what divine <b>love</b> has given.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#263:22">Page 263</a>   None of the saints did anything to get that place or to retain it; the Father's <b>love</b> gave them that place.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#263:23">Page 263</a>   To partake of the divine nature is a fact, a blessed divine reality brought about by the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#264:8">Page 264</a>  Nothing has any place in the assembly that is not the outcome of <b>love</b>, and what is the outcome of <b>love</b> edifies.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#264:23">Page 264</a>   We are bound up with Christ for eternity; not a darkening element is left to obscure our joy in the <b>love</b> of the Father.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#264:24">Page 264</a>   We enjoy as those identified with the place which Christ has before the Father as the Son of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#264:26">Page 264</a>   We are brought to a circle where <b>love</b> predominates -- the kingdom of the Son of His <b>love</b> -- a beautiful aspect of the kingdom.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#264:27">Page 264</a>   It is the influence of <b>love</b> that liberates from every distraction.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#265:10">Page 265</a>   Redemption subsists in all the value of the Person who is the Son of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#266:8">Page 266</a>   He "has delivered us from the authority of darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#266:14">Page 266</a>   That was placing them in the kingdom of the Son of His <b>love</b>, putting them under the influence of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#266:15">Page 266</a>   There are two lines we <b>love</b> to sing addressing the Lord,  'The light of <b>love</b> has shone in Thee,  And in that <b>love</b> our souls are free'.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#266:26">Page 266</a>   <b>Love</b> is supreme there; the very One whose influence we come under is the beloved Son.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#266:27">Page 266</a>   All the influences there are the influences of divine <b>love</b>; they set the heart free.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#266:28">Page 266</a>   We get into bondage to many things because we are not in the region of the Father's actings, and not in the consciousness of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#266:29">Page 266</a>   Many things fetter us, impede our movements, and obscure our vision, they would all perish at once if we touch the sphere where the Father is acting and where <b>love</b> predominates<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#267:1">Page 267</a>   The Father's actings are in view of positive liberty, He "has made us fit for sharing the portion of the saints in light", He "has delivered us from the authority of darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his <b>love</b>: in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#267:10">Page 267</a>   If we are free in the light of <b>love</b> we can quietly and without distraction contemplate the exceeding greatness of the Person who is the image of the invisible God -- One suitable to take the place of pre-eminence in all creation.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#268:8">Page 268</a>   The full unfolding of the <b>love</b> of God came out in the death of His Son and the revelation was complete: God is in the light revealed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#268:9">Page 268</a>   But the image is what abides, an abiding shining out of all that God is in light and <b>love</b> in a risen and glorified Man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#268:16">Page 268</a>   The true Head was held in reserve, in view of all God's purposes of grace and sovereign <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#268:21">Page 268</a>  We are set free in the light of <b>love</b> to entertain the thought of all this, and to see how great that Person is who is Head of the body, the assembly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#274:1">Page 274</a>  We were speaking in the early part of this chapter of our being brought into the kingdom of the Son of the Father's <b>love</b>: as our hearts are affected and brought under the dominating influence of that kingdom, our affections are liberated so that they are free for Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#274:8">Page 274</a>   In the cup we drink into the <b>love</b> of God, and as we do it sets us free.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#274:9">Page 274</a>   Nothing sets free like <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#274:10">Page 274</a>   In the presence of divine <b>love</b> we are free for Christ, and free to take in the wonderful thoughts which are presented in such a scripture as this.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#281:22">Page 281</a>   That is not so far as being covered with kisses: the prodigal is brought into the embrace of <b>love</b>, into sonship.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#288:12">Page 288</a>   There is no knitting together if people are discouraged; discouraged hearts tend to scatter, but when hearts are encouraged there is a power to unite together in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#288:15">Page 288</a>   If our hearts are encouraged and knit together in <b>love</b> we shall get the full assurance of understanding as to the mystery of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#288:17">Page 288</a>   It is not now in display, it is hidden, and only known to people with encouraged hearts, who are knit together in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#303:2">Page 303</a>   We gladly embrace the privilege of just looking at ourselves as subjects of the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#311:24">Page 311</a>   We do not want morally the place where He has died; if we <b>love</b> Him and know His <b>love</b> we do not want to live where He has died.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#320:9">Page 320</a>  Then to all these we are to add <b>love</b>, which is the divine bond to hold saints together in the perfectness of those relations which pertain to the body.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#320:11">Page 320</a>   <b>Love</b> would really bring about perfectness -- that is, relations between the saints which could not be improved upon.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#325:25">Page 325</a>   <b>Love</b> proposes to give one.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#326:17">Page 326</a>   I think He refers to the portion He enjoyed as Man moving through this world in His Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#326:18">Page 326</a>   He said, "I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#327:23">Page 327</a>   It would be done in <b>love</b> to bring them up to the standard, to bring them into line, rather than in censure.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#329:28">Page 329</a>   That is why we <b>love</b> them, because they have been so beautifully illustrated in Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#340:5">Page 340</a>   It is a question whether we are set to further what is of God; nothing is of value except what furthers faith and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#340:7">Page 340</a>   What we should earnestly seek for ourselves and for one another is that we should be built up in faith and in <b>love</b>; nothing else is any good.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#340:17">Page 340</a>   The end in view is that <b>love</b> might be active.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#340:18">Page 340</a>   Faith is not the end, it is the means to an end, and if it is genuine faith, faith unfeigned, it will work <b>love</b>; it could not be genuine faith if it remained dead.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#342:7">Page 342</a>   If we are lacking in <b>love</b> out of these three things -- a pure heart, a good conscience and unfeigned faith, we are sure to go off on legal lines, the principle of the schoolmaster and the policeman come in.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#342:33">Page 342</a>   Take all the injunctions in christianity, the end of them all is <b>love</b>, that is the end in view, so it is very simple; everything can be reduced to this element<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#343:1">Page 343</a>   Take any point of ecclesiastical order, or any principles, they are all the actings of <b>love</b> reduced to its natural elements.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#343:2">Page 343</a>   If <b>love</b> is acting, I shall not steal, or kill or bear false witness; I do not want a man's ox, or his ass, or anything that is his.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#343:4">Page 343</a>  When Paul exercised himself to have a conscience void of offence, he doubtless turned over in his mind if he had acted contrary to <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#343:6">Page 343</a>   We should challenge our hearts in God's presence, and ask, Was it <b>love</b> that led me to do that?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#343:10">Page 343</a>   His glory is the activity of His <b>love</b>, and that is what the enemy is seeking to obscure.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#343:27">Page 343</a>   God accounts as His glory the scope He has given to His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#343:28">Page 343</a>   The glory of the blessed God has come in as the spring of <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#344:4">Page 344</a>   Do we <b>love</b> good and feel that we are trustees for it, that we hold it for others?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#344:6">Page 344</a>   Peter speaks of our having purified our hearts unto unfeigned <b>love</b> of the brethren.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#344:9">Page 344</a>   And he says, "See that ye <b>love</b> one another".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#344:10">Page 344</a>   Let nothing interfere with the working out of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#347:15">Page 347</a>  Then we were seeing in a former meeting that the dispensation of God is in faith, and the end of all enjoined is <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#347:16">Page 347</a>   Faith and <b>love</b> are what God has before Him to bring about in man, and now (verse 14), we find they are supplied by the grace of our Lord, they are supplied from heaven.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#347:17">Page 347</a>   This is a summing up of salvation; man is brought into faith exercised towards God, and <b>love</b> exercised towards man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#347:18">Page 347</a>   The man who has these two requisites is saved; he is in right relation to God by faith, and to man by <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#348:2">Page 348</a>  You cannot surpass faith and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#348:3">Page 348</a>   The smallest servant who is acting in faith and <b>love</b> is morally as great as an apostle.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#348:4">Page 348</a>   An apostle may act in a large sphere, but he cannot go beyond faith and <b>love</b>; and we may act in a small sphere, but we cannot go beyond faith and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#348:7">Page 348</a>   The great thing is the character of the men who serve, not the amount of their service, but that it should be the outcome of faith and <b>love</b> in Christ Jesus.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#348:9">Page 348</a>   Service flows from faith and <b>love</b>, and not from obligation.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#349:2">Page 349</a>   It was grace that administered faith and <b>love</b>, they are not demanded, they are supplied.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#349:3">Page 349</a>   God does not say you must have faith and <b>love</b>, but He supplies them in the grace of the Lord Jesus, and the result is an entirely new order of man in this world, men characterised by faith and <b>love</b>, and by being in Christ Jesus: a new kind of man in this world.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#349:4">Page 349</a>   "Faith and <b>love</b> .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#349:8">Page 349</a>   It is a present moral reality; it is not only God's purpose in Christ in heaven to have us like that glorified Man by and by, but it is faith and <b>love</b> in Christ now.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#349:10">Page 349</a>   The same created being, once fallen, and lost, and marked by everything contrary to God, is now recovered in a new order altogether, and that new order is characterised by faith and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#349:13">Page 349</a>   The more faith works by <b>love</b>, the more grace one would have.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#352:15">Page 352</a>   We ought to remember that  we  are to give voice to everything according to God, whether it is the dependence of a creature and the confidingness of those who know His <b>love</b>, or the thanksgiving of those who have His general benefits all find a voice in the house of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#355:6">Page 355</a>   We are drawn together by the <b>love</b> and grace of God's heart to be at home in His presence, in holy liberty to speak to Him, and to hear Him speak to us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#355:17">Page 355</a>   Undoubtedly, we are always in God's house, and if we are marked by the faith and <b>love</b> that is in Christ Jesus in our individual path, keeping in view the end of what is enjoined, <b>love</b> out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned, I think we shall be quite ready to take up priestly service in prayer and praise when we come together in assembly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#357:30">Page 357</a>   There has been a blessed Man moving about amongst men, who has in every activity of His life manifested what God is in His <b>love</b> and grace to men, and the Spirit has justified that Man: the witness of it is that He has been received up into glory.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#358:11">Page 358</a>   It is the assembly of the living God where all the blessed activities of His <b>love</b> and grace emanate from.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#358:12">Page 358</a>  I suppose <b>love</b> is the most prominent and characteristic of His activities and that it comes out in the ways of saints towards each other.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#358:27">Page 358</a>   It involved suffering in lowly grace, in a Man, to vindicate God and reveal the blessed thought of His heart, and so the Son of the Father's <b>love</b> said, "Lo, I come": the Man who perfectly answered to God in everything.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#359:21">Page 359</a>   I <b>love</b> what is said of Christ, "I have exalted one chosen out of the people .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#371:23">Page 371</a>   There is a further incentive to faithful service, <b>love</b> to your brother.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#373:41">Page 373</a>   It is not money that is dangerous but the <b>love</b> of it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#373:46">Page 373</a>   It just shows what a terrible leverage Satan has over the heart of man by the <b>love</b> of money.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#374:4">Page 374</a>   The currency of the realm to which we belong is "righteousness, godliness, faith, <b>love</b>, patience, meekness" (verse 11), and those are the things we are to pursue and to enrich ourselves in.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#374:24">Page 374</a>   Then piety brings God into everything, then faith in God -- one is built up of God, then <b>love</b> is in exercise.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#375:6">Page 375</a>   It is in contrast to the <b>love</b> of money.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#382:10">Page 382</a>  In verse 13 Timothy is enjoined to have an outline of sound words which he had heard of Paul in faith and <b>love</b> which are in Christ Jesus.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#382:11">Page 382</a>   Now you have faith and <b>love</b>, that is, in the soul of Timothy.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#384:6">Page 384</a>  I think that "in Christ Jesus" stands in relation to what is outside time, to what lies in the purpose of God outside time; but it is being effectuated today, so there is faith and <b>love</b> which are in Christ Jesus.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#384:7">Page 384</a>   Speaking generally, faith is connected with divine Persons, and <b>love</b> has its activity towards the brethren.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#385:16">Page 385</a>   Paul says to the Galatians, "in Christ Jesus neither circumcision has any force, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#387:5">Page 387</a>   That was true brotherly <b>love</b>, and he was not ashamed of the chain.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#387:15">Page 387</a>   The gospel is what there is for men in the grace and <b>love</b> of God, but the assembly is what is secured for God and Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#387:17">Page 387</a>   We are therefore glad to move off on to the line of faith and <b>love</b> in Christ Jesus and to keep things by the Holy Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#389:23">Page 389</a>   in faith and <b>love</b> which is in Christ Jesus".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#389:26">Page 389</a>   Faith and <b>love</b> are inseparable.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#389:29">Page 389</a>   It was what marked believers when they were really in life that they had faith in Christ Jesus and <b>love</b> to all saints, and the thing is to be of the order of those who are strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#389:32">Page 389</a>   It is faith and <b>love</b> in Christ Jesus, and saints are in Christ Jesus.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#390:1">Page 390</a>   Faith and <b>love</b> are to mark saints down here.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#391:3">Page 391</a>   Nothing is of any good that does not work by faith and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#391:4">Page 391</a>   Faith works by <b>love</b> and that is quite a different thing.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#391:6">Page 391</a>   Faith working by <b>love</b>  is  Christ formed in saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#391:10">Page 391</a>   Faith working by <b>love</b> is christianity; the Man was really being brought into the world.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#392:10">Page 392</a>   An atmosphere of <b>love</b> would promote growth.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#394:16">Page 394</a>   We see earnest people, who <b>love</b> the Lord, doing exceedingly foolish things, and imagining that they are serving God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#398:16">Page 398</a>   If we remember that and take account of it and all it involves -- He does not live in this world -- if I believe and <b>love</b>, am I going to live in the place where He is dead, as Festus said, or am I in my affections and mind going to take the place of having died with Him in view of living together with Him?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#398:21">Page 398</a>   If God's salvation and blessing and the revelation of God in <b>love</b> are all bound up in my heart with that Person, what is the effect?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#403:23">Page 403</a>   The principle of attraction is found in following "righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace" (verse 22); if christians took account of  me  as following righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace, they would want to be with me.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#403:26">Page 403</a>   Then there is what men can take account of -- "pursue righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#405:14">Page 405</a>   There is no security for any of us save as we pursue righteousness, faith, <b>love</b> and peace.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#405:24">Page 405</a>   Even though the people were recalled to the Scriptures, yet faith and <b>love</b> ceased to characterise them, so that when the Lord came to earth He had to reproach the people that there was not faith or <b>love</b> with them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#405:37">Page 405</a>   He says, "<b>love</b> one another out of a pure heart fervently".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#405:38">Page 405</a>   I think a pure heart is a heart delivered from selfishness by the knowledge of the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#405:39">Page 405</a>   The <b>love</b> of God gives one a pure heart because it breaks the power of the selfish motives that had governed us<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#406:1">Page 406</a>   Nothing will break the power of selfishness but <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#406:2">Page 406</a>   A heart brought under the influence of the <b>love</b> of God is free from all those things that mark the natural man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#406:3">Page 406</a>   If God has given me everything in His <b>love</b> I do not need to be seeking and grasping after something for myself, and then one can call on God with a simple reference to God's will, with nothing but a true desire to walk in the path of God's will.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#406:25">Page 406</a>   The exercise with us should be to be here for God's will; we are set to "pursue righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace"; all these things are the will of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#407:12">Page 407</a>   The snare of the devil is anything that takes us off the line of God's will, and of righteousness, faith, <b>love</b> and peace.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#408:9">Page 408</a>   The men in chapter 3 are clearly unconverted persons; they have "no <b>love</b> for what is good", they are "lovers of pleasure".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#408:13">Page 408</a>   If people have no <b>love</b> for what is good, what can you do with them?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#409:22">Page 409</a>   We find it all through this epistle: there is "faith and <b>love</b> .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#410:16">Page 410</a>   Then the contrast is in "my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, <b>love</b>, endurance, persecutions, sufferings .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#410:28">Page 410</a>   Judas went out from the circle of divine <b>love</b> and carried an element into the world which had never existed before; it was the element of apostasy.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#410:35">Page 410</a>   He is to follow Paul, and we are to follow Paul's teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, <b>love</b>, endurance.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#419:14">Page 419</a>   The apostle never turned back, never left his first <b>love</b>; he went on.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#419:15">Page 419</a>   If you speak of his failure, it grew out of his <b>love</b> to his people and going after them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#419:16">Page 419</a>   His very failures were due to Christ's <b>love</b> in his heart towards his people, but the Lord never says to him, 'You have failed'.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#431:1">Page 431</a>   If we committed ourselves to these things we should learn the <b>love</b> of Christ in a way we have never learnt it before.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#434:5">Page 434</a>   Many things in Scripture have been held in reserve; the typical teaching of the Old Testament is among the reserve stores of divine wisdom and <b>love</b> kept to encourage us in our exercises today.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#437:2">Page 437</a>   Whatever the ruin, we must hold that divine thoughts remain at the end what they were at the beginning, and it is the exercise of faith and <b>love</b> to be in accord with them; it is impossible for them to change.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#446:5">Page 446</a>  We may learn from the verses read the kind of material of which the local assembly is formed; it is composed of persons who have the consciousness of the present <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#446:8">Page 446</a>   The first feature of the local assembly is that it is a company of persons in the consciousness of the present <b>love</b> of Christ; then they can say, He "has washed us from our sins in his blood".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#446:20">Page 446</a>   As these spiritual features are present -- the consciousness of Christ's present <b>love</b>, of being washed from every stain of what pertained to our former history, and as constituted a kingdom -- there is the establishment in a company of persons locally of what is morally suitable to God<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#458:13">Page 458</a>   Nehemiah takes account of God as keeping covenant and mercy to them that <b>love</b> Him and keep His commandments.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#458:26">Page 458</a>   Nehemiah does not pray that the people may return, but he takes for granted that there will be those who <b>love</b> God and keep His commandments, so he says, "let now thine ear be attentive .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#462:39">Page 462</a>   Timothy largely describes the kind of material suitable for God to use in a day of ruin: faithful men; those who live piously in Christ Jesus; those who follow righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace, with those who call upon the Lord out of a pure heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#466:12">Page 466</a>   In a day of ruin God calls attention to the great principle attaching to the assembly -- <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#468:12">Page 468</a>   All this fits into 2 Timothy, where we are exhorted to follow righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace, with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#473:24">Page 473</a>   Paul speaks of "all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in <b>love</b>" that is the valley-gate.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#482:17">Page 482</a>   His coming in liberated the heart of God; all the <b>love</b> and grace of forgiveness was in God's heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#482:21">Page 482</a>   In  Psalm 16  we see His moral perfections as walking here before God, separate from the idolatrous world, and making those who <b>love</b> God, the excellent of the earth, His companions.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#488:32">Page 488</a>   The thought has come to me sometimes that if I could have the consciousness of the presence of God and His <b>love</b> I could go through anything; that seems incontrovertible.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#490:8">Page 490</a>  Romans 8  shows that all these things do not separate us from the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#490:9">Page 490</a>   Is the <b>love</b> of Christ enough?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#490:10">Page 490</a>   Are we content as to the public position to be in derision, contempt, and reproach, but to have compensation in the <b>love</b> of Christ, so that we would rather be in reproach than anything else?<br>

<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#493:19">Page 493</a>   The consciousness of being inseparable from the <b>love</b> of Christ, and when that comes into the soul it prepares us for  Psalm 45 .<br>

<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#495:2">Page 495</a>   The compensation for the position in  Psalm 44  is that we get to know our inseparableness from the <b>love</b> of Christ, and if we have found compensation we can compose something: "I say what I have composed".<br>

<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#499:4">Page 499</a>   It is wonderful to see what the kingdom does as vested in the Son of the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#499:5">Page 499</a>   It brings us to <b>love</b> what Christ loves and to hate what Christ hates.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#499:6">Page 499</a>   The kingdom is vested in that Person, so we cannot come under the influence of Christ without loving what He loves and hating what He hates; and the measure in which that is true is the measure in which we have come into the kingdom of the Son of the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#499:8">Page 499</a>   What a wonderful kingdom where the subjects <b>love</b> what the King loves and hate what the King hates!<br>

<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#501:24">Page 501</a>   We need to cultivate an intensely individual sense of our relationship to Christ, that we <b>love</b> Him and He loves us; it is an intimate personal thing.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#501:25">Page 501</a>   We think a great deal about our being affected by His <b>love</b> and company, and we may be, but there is another consideration.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#501:28">Page 501</a>   He has told us He is greatly affected by our <b>love</b>; He is so affected by it that He will come to us.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#506:4">Page 506</a>   Christ has companions morally who <b>love</b> righteousness and hate lawlessness; they are marked by such affection that they build ivory palaces and have stringed instruments in them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac9.htm#507:17">Page 507</a>   There is a strengthening by the Father's Spirit in all the affections of the inner man so that the Christ may dwell in our hearts by faith, and it is all to apprehend with every believer "what is the breadth and length and depth and height; and to know the <b>love</b> of the Christ which surpasses knowledge; that ye may be filled even to all the fulness of God.<br>

<h3>Volume 10 - An Outline of Luke's Gospel</h3>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#2:20">Page 2</a>   It was a necessity to God's <b>love</b> that He should speak out of His nature, His thoughts and His heart, and that He should have beings capable of appreciating it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#10:19">Page 10</a>   But <b>love</b> your enemies and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing in return, and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be sons of the Highest".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#13:8">Page 13</a>   We came to them in a spirit of subjection as subdued by the grace and <b>love</b> which has made them known.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#21:7">Page 21</a>   Scripture does not say that God is grace or that God is mercy, but that God is <b>love</b>; that is what He is in His nature, and mercy and grace both flow from that.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#25:5">Page 25</a>   It is perfection in an infant to be the subject of maternal <b>love</b> and care, and in that place His trust was in God;  Psalm 22:9 , 10.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#32:21">Page 32</a>  Circumcision was "a sign of the covenant" ( Genesis 17 ), and the presentation of the hallowed firstborn intimated God's purpose to have sons for the pleasure of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#33:1">Page 33</a>   In the circumcision of Jesus, and His presentation as firstborn to Jehovah, these two precious thoughts of divine <b>love</b> are viewed as brought to fruition.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#57:13">Page 57</a>   God has secured it in one Man; what He had cherished in the purpose of His <b>love</b> from eternity, He has secured in one Man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#58:5">Page 58</a>   He came to that place in view of God's thought to have many sons before Him for the pleasure of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#60:11">Page 60</a>   I need not say that there was much more than fulfilled responsibility in Christ, for there was in Him the perfect setting forth of the favour and <b>love</b> of God to men, but we are speaking for the moment of what was tested and brought out by the temptations of the devil.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#63:27">Page 63</a>   As in the shining of God's <b>love</b> and delight the outgoings of the heart are in a worshipping spirit<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#67:2">Page 67</a>   One who is dwelling in the secret place -- one might say, in the very bosom of God -- does not need any circumstance, sign, or miracle to make him sure of God's <b>love</b> and care.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#67:6">Page 67</a>   He was under the warmth and cherishing of the <b>love</b> and care of God, and He did not need any outward sign of it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#67:9">Page 67</a>   The dependent Man, full of the Holy Spirit, was in the most intimate enjoyment of the <b>love</b> of God; He lived there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#67:10">Page 67</a>   It has been said that we cannot live in the world and we do not yet live in heaven; the only place where we can live is in the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#67:11">Page 67</a>   If you live continuously in the known <b>love</b> of a person, you do not think of putting that <b>love</b> to any test; to do so would be a proof of distrust.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#67:16">Page 67</a>   because the <b>love</b> of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#67:18">Page 67</a>   I do not know the <b>love</b> of God by outward circumstances; He might allow me to suffer very severely.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#67:19">Page 67</a>   Many of our brethren suffer very severely; their outward circumstances do not seem to evidence that God loves them, but we know the <b>love</b> of God by the fact that Christ has died for us, and the Spirit of God pours that <b>love</b> into our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#67:21">Page 67</a>   The <b>love</b> of God is a blessed secret only known to those who come into the light of the death of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#67:22">Page 67</a>   As Christians we cherish this wonderful secret, We know the <b>love</b> of God in two ways; by the expression of it in the death of His Son, and by the Spirit shedding it abroad in our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#68:1">Page 68</a>  It is very sweet to think that God has a secret place in the heart of one where His <b>love</b> has become known, and we have a secret place in the heart of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#68:2">Page 68</a>   "Because he hath set his <b>love</b> upon me".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#68:3">Page 68</a>   There was a blessed Man in this world who set His <b>love</b> upon God, and that is our privilege too.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#68:4">Page 68</a>   Then there will be no thought of requiring some outward evidence of His <b>love</b>; we have it in the secret of our hearts by the Holy Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#68:9">Page 68</a>   They have been so happy in His known <b>love</b> that they have not wanted Him to change their circumstances; they have not wanted any outward sign.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#68:11">Page 68</a>   It is a great triumph on God's part to make one m such circumstances conscious of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#68:12">Page 68</a>   I remember an old sister who had never been outside the four walls of her little room for thirty-five years, and, when my mother went to see her and said something to her about the <b>love</b> of God, she said, 'O, the <b>love</b> of God, it swallows me up'.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#68:17">Page 68</a>   Then you do not need to put the <b>love</b> of God to the test.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#69:2">Page 69</a>  It is of the greatest importance that we should cultivate the secret life of our spirits with God, so that we taste the known <b>love</b> of God all along, and do not wait until we get into a tight place and then look to God for deliverance, and take it as a proof of His care and <b>love</b>; but we live in the sweetness and blessedness of the known <b>love</b> of God all the time.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#69:3">Page 69</a>    Romans 8  tell us that nothing can separate us from the <b>love</b> of God or the <b>love</b> of Christ; these are things from the preciousness of which nothing can separate us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#69:5">Page 69</a>   Nothing is more humbling than to think what a little thing can upset us; it shows how little we are really living in the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#74:12">Page 74</a>   It makes us <b>love</b> God when we know that is the way He has taken, to know that He has brought in such a wonderful Person.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#85:17">Page 85</a>   He did so because only in relation to a sinful creature could He disclose the marvellous depth, riches and fulness of His great grace and the <b>love</b> of His heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#97:8">Page 97</a>   So that he evidently loved the Jews because of their relation to God; he would favour that relation as much as he could, It is fine evidence that faith is operating in the soul when there is <b>love</b> to the people of God, and desire that they may prosper spiritually.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#99:5">Page 99</a>   He would <b>love</b> to make Himself known to every sorrowing heart as He made Himself known to the bereaved widow of Nain, that is, as entering compassionately into the sorrow, and as having power to relieve the heart that is oppressed by it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#101:10">Page 101</a>   This woman's tears and kisses and anointing of His feet, her much <b>love</b>, showed how great she was.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#101:16">Page 101</a>  The evangelical part of Christendom is largely occupied with the thought of working for Jesus, but it is a much greater thing to minister to Him in <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#102:1">Page 102</a>   Simon failed to do so, and I think we may say that Jesus is in Simon's house now as being where He is outwardly honoured, but where few hearts really minister to Him in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#102:6">Page 102</a>   She knew that she was a sinner, and that her sins were many, but the thought of this gave her an intense appreciation of the grace she had perceived in Jesus, and filled her soul with deep gratitude and <b>love</b> which could not be held back from expressing itself even in the chilling atmosphere of a Pharisee's house.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#102:15">Page 102</a>   There were two debtors of a certain creditor: one owned five hundred denarii and the other fifty; but as they had nothing to pay, he forgave both of them their debt: say, which of them therefore will <b>love</b>: him most?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#102:21">Page 102</a>   The heart of one who is conscious of being a great debtor is deeply moved with gratitude and <b>love</b> when he learns the grace of the Creditor.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#102:22">Page 102</a>   He would do anything to show his <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#103:3">Page 103</a>   I may even be a professed believer in Jesus, and yet <b>love</b> Him little because I have a small sense of how much He has forgiven.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#103:4">Page 103</a>   What Jesus gets from me and what God gets from me in the ministry of <b>love</b> depends on the sense I have in my heart of how much He has forgiven me.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#103:5">Page 103</a>   This is how God is winning the heart of His poor fallen creature, for the real truth of the gospel is not so much that man needs God but that God needs man to display His kindness and grace upon him, and to secure his <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#103:6">Page 103</a>   It is wonderful that God should want my <b>love</b>, sinner as I am.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#103:7">Page 103</a>   He wanted the woman's <b>love</b> and He wanted Simon's <b>love</b>; He got the first, but He did not get the second, and He felt it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#103:12">Page 103</a>   There is a proverb which says, "He that covereth transgression seeketh <b>love</b>" ( Proverbs 17:9 ); that was what was in His heart, and in the woman He found what He sought.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#103:13">Page 103</a>   She had broken through all the conventionalities in the strength of her much <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#103:14">Page 103</a>   It is  our  privilege now, in the face of a cold and heartless profession, to show that we <b>love</b> Him much, not merely by working for Him, but by lavishing upon Him personally that which <b>love</b> only can give.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#103:15">Page 103</a>   None of us would dare to say that we had been forgiven little, but many of us might well pray that we might have a deeper sense of how much we have been forgiven, so that we might <b>love</b> much.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#104:1">Page 104</a>   But to Simon He would speak of her <b>love</b> as justifying her forgiveness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#104:13">Page 104</a>   The authority of those whom He has chosen to be apostles must be everywhere owned, for they are the representatives of His authority, but there must also be the subjective state set forth in the women, who were healed persons, set free from the power of evil, and now ministering to Him in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#105:1">Page 105</a>   The true character of the kingdom of God is that the authority of Jesus is owned, but it is owned by those whose sins have been forgiven, and who have been healed of wicked spirits and infirmities, and who now <b>love</b> Him much and minister to Him as the woman did in Simon's house.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#105:4">Page 105</a>   Where Jesus is loved and ministered to, and where His heart is gratified by what He receives from those who <b>love</b> Him, there is the kingdom of God in power.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#105:11">Page 105</a>   One important way in which <b>love</b> to the Lord Jesus comes into expression is by regard for that assembly order which He has instituted.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#107:13">Page 107</a>   That act of <b>love</b> means very little to the world, but it means much to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#108:15">Page 108</a>  " If we say that, we tempt Him; we have called His <b>love</b> in question.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#113:17">Page 113</a>   When Israel is quickened they will answer to God; they will <b>love</b> God with all their heart, and their neighbour as themselves.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#114:13">Page 114</a>   I have known what it is to be concerned and worried about something, and to come to the Lord's supper and get such a sense of His <b>love</b> that I felt what had troubled me did not matter a straw.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#120:21">Page 120</a>   If we knew what it was to be immersed in that -- justification, peace with God, access, the <b>love</b> of God, reconciliation and eternal life -- we should have a great desire to be baptised in the sea, to accept death to the system controlled by Satan in order to be here for God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#122:13">Page 122</a>   If you could look at it you would find your name, and the names of all who <b>love</b> the Lord Jesus Christ, inscribed there as present citizens of heaven.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#123:17">Page 123</a>   This dispensation has heaven in view, so the full height of everything on the divine side is brought in in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#123:19">Page 123</a>   What satisfies divine <b>love</b> must be a scene where no evil is present.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#128:3">Page 128</a>  It is remarkable that it is the question of the neighbour that is raised in this man's conscience, not of <b>love</b> to God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#128:5">Page 128</a>   The Lord had shown how the first part, <b>love</b> to God, is secured in chapter 7.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#128:6">Page 128</a>   God is securing the <b>love</b> of His poor debtors; the great Creditor comes out in the grace of forgiveness, and secures the <b>love</b> of the worst debtor by forgiving all.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#133:5">Page 133</a>   In  John 17  we get into deeper waters; there we find a new relationship set up in which the saints are set and are loved with the same <b>love</b> as the Son; but this prayer has to do with the light of revelation before relationship is realised.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#145:7">Page 145</a>   God moves to us in grace that we may move to Him in <b>love</b>, and in result the light that is going to fill the city will be found morally in the saints now.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#147:10">Page 147</a>   God is working to bring people to have no confidence in the flesh; His complaint about the Pharisees was that they were particular about little things, but left aside judgment and the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#147:19">Page 147</a>   The judgment of God is not considered and the <b>love</b> of God not known.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#147:23">Page 147</a>   To maintain the judgment of God and the <b>love</b> of God there is a vessel of light, and it is in contrast with the religious system that professes to honour Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#147:24">Page 147</a>   The things the Lord speaks of in this chapter are the positive things -- the judgment of God, the <b>love</b> of God, wisdom, the key of knowledge, the Holy Spirit -- what an amount of precious substance shining in contrast to the system of darkness<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#151:10">Page 151</a>   God is able to act in the faithfulness of His own covenant towards sinful men, because the very Man who sits upon the throne has died on the cross for them, and everything the light has exposed <b>love</b> has removed, so there is no need for covering anything up; it is all out.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#152:6">Page 152</a>   It is the appreciation of Christ; He has formed a judgment and expressed it, and our wisdom is to pay attention to the judgment of God; then we come into the apprehension of the <b>love</b> of God, and then go on to the wisdom of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#161:2">Page 161</a>   The reward is not a place of administration, but His personal act of <b>love</b> towards them; the reward corresponds with the place of trust.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#161:3">Page 161</a>   Nothing could be more precious than that the Lord should serve us, giving us a sense of the <b>love</b> that delights to serve.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#175:14">Page 175</a>   It was Jehovah in the yearnings of His <b>love</b> over the city He had chosen; He had often been prepared to take them under the warmth and cherishing of His protecting <b>love</b>, but they would not.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#175:22">Page 175</a>   It is very much like the attitude He takes up in regard to Laodicea: He is standing at the door and is ready to come in in the yearnings of His faithful <b>love</b>, but He is outside<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#176:14">Page 176</a>   The prophetic voice of Christ is there even if men do not listen; the Lord has not ceased to speak in prophetic warning and in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#177:18">Page 177</a>  We may profess to think nothing of self; we are often ready to say self-depreciating things; but God is working to make it true, and it is in presence of His <b>love</b> that we learn to take the lowest place.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#179:2">Page 179</a>   Mutuality is found in the family circle; <b>love</b> is in the family circle, but grace is always one-sided, it is all on God's side and flows down from God to unworthy men.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#179:3">Page 179</a>   We must have grace first, then <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#179:4">Page 179</a>   In the family circle you have <b>love</b> and mutuality, but this is the kingdom, not the family, and in the kingdom we are to be prepared for the service of grace.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#179:13">Page 179</a>   Paul did not want recompense; he said, "the more abundantly I <b>love</b> the less I am loved", The Lord would discourage us from providing for people who can give back as good as we give them, but He tells us to manifest grace to those who cannot give to us, and then we shall have something in resurrection.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#180:3">Page 180</a>   There is nothing more one-sided than resurrection: there is a man dead in the grave, and the sovereign power of God acting in <b>love</b> comes in and raises him, and God has His recompense.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#183:12">Page 183</a>   You cannot say, I will have Jesus, and all His <b>love</b> and grace to men, and I will not have anything else; if you have Him in His <b>love</b> and grace to men you must have Him in His faithfulness to God -- that is the faithfulness of discipleship.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#188:17">Page 188</a>   But Jesus has come forth in marvellous <b>love</b> and grace.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#196:18">Page 196</a>   The covering with kisses gives the consciousness of God's <b>love</b>; that is bound up in the gift of the Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#197:2">Page 197</a>   Have you ever had the indescribable sense of the <b>love</b> of God and the pleasure He has had in turning you to Himself?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#197:5">Page 197</a>   The sense of that in the soul is by the Spirit; all the <b>love</b> concentrated at Calvary is now diffused in millions of hearts by the Spirit, and every one of them is conscious of having been kissed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#197:7">Page 197</a>   The <b>love</b> of God is brought into our hearts by the Spirit, so that the disposition of God towards us is known inwardly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#197:21">Page 197</a>   The kisses are the profound depth of the heart of God breaking out on this subject of <b>love</b>; the heart of God breaks out in all its fulness, and the prodigal feels that God loves him with all His heart<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#198:13">Page 198</a>   That is how the Lord presents the matter; we have a statement that could not possibly be made by anyone except the Son of the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#199:3">Page 199</a>  In the beginning of Ephesians Paul speaks of God having chosen the saints in Christ before the foundation of the world that they might be holy and without blame before Him in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#199:16">Page 199</a>   I am conscious that nothing else will suit Him, or suit me if I <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#201:19">Page 201</a>  The fatted calf suggests Christ as the One in whom we have seen the tenderness and excellency of <b>love</b> that would secure all the thoughts of God righteously in a way suitable to God; all is secured through death<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#208:6">Page 208</a>   Money in a broad sense is the mammon of unrighteousness, and the <b>love</b> of money is the root of all evil.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#211:4">Page 211</a>   John puts it very seriously: "How abides the <b>love</b> of God in him?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#212:5">Page 212</a>   A man has to be violent enough to force his way through every obstacle, and the <b>love</b> of money is the greatest obstacle there can be; you have to push your way through it and everything else, no matter what it is.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#215:13">Page 215</a>  "O keep us, <b>love</b> divine, near Thee  That we our nothingness may know".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#230:22">Page 230</a>   Now we have another world, things "which eye has not seen and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that <b>love</b> him, but God has revealed to us by his Spirit".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#236:1">Page 236</a>   He gives a long list of the way he had behaved himself and the different characteristics of his service and labours: "in everything commending ourselves as God's ministers, in much endurance, in afflictions, in necessities, in straits, in stripes, in prisons, in riots, in labours, in watchings, in fastings, in pureness, in knowledge, in long-suffering, in kindness, in the Holy Ghost, in <b>love</b> unfeigned, in the word of truth, in the power of God; through the arms of righteousness on the right hand and left, through glory and dishonour, through evil report and good report: as deceivers, and true; as unknown and well known; as dying, and behold we live; as disciplined, and not put to death; as grieved, but always rejoicing; as poor, but enriching many; as having nothing, and possessing all things".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#236:10">Page 236</a>   For instance whatever you could do in the way of service is a small matter compared with the place you have according to the purpose of everlasting <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#237:1">Page 237</a>   Responsibility is a test of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#237:2">Page 237</a>   "If ye <b>love</b> me, keep my commandments" -- that is, everything that has the character of commandment, and I suppose all responsibility has that character, but it becomes a test of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#237:3">Page 237</a>   That found out the man who did not <b>love</b> his lord.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#237:4">Page 237</a>   The point was that he did not <b>love</b> him; he made a lame excuse.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#237:6">Page 237</a>   The man who wrapped his pound in a towel did not <b>love</b> his lord; he saw nothing to <b>love</b> in him, only an austere man, exacting unduly: his apprehension of his lord was not such as to make him a lover.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#242:17">Page 242</a>   Now in contrast to that we are to "follow righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart" -- a company with pure affections.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#243:17">Page 243</a>   So the Lord in dealing with Laodicea is still faithful to His own <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#243:18">Page 243</a>   "As many as I <b>love</b> I rebuke and discipline" -- it is a slighted Lover but a Lover still.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#245:15">Page 245</a>   All teaching necessitates enlargement in the knowledge of God in His grace and in His <b>love</b> to men.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#251:3">Page 251</a>  What is due to God would be that the immense obligation that His grace and <b>love</b> have revealed to us in Christ and made good to us in our hearts by the Spirit should have a suitable response.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#252:10">Page 252</a>  The Lord would lead us in spirit outside the natural into that world where there is no death, and where we shall be equal to angels, beings who have been preserved by God's electing <b>love</b> and power in an unfallen state.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#257:18">Page 257</a>  All the sweetness of His wondrous <b>love</b> came out in the private circle, although the traitor was there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#263:9">Page 263</a>   I should doubt whether this particular character of the Lord's <b>love</b> expressed in death will ever be entered into by any other family; whereas the passover will have its place in the millennium for Israel.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#266:11">Page 266</a>   The remembrance spoken of by the Lord in Luke and by Paul in Corinthians is a character of remembrance that can be taken up by people who never saw Him, people such as Peter speaks of who can say, "whom having not seen ye <b>love</b>",  1 Peter 1:8 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#267:17">Page 267</a>   It is the giving of <b>love</b> that is emphasised, but it is to be appropriated.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#267:19">Page 267</a>  Luke emphasises the giving as bringing out the Lord's own action in <b>love</b>, but then all the Lord has given in His body subsists for the assembly, so we can say at all times that it is for us<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#268:17">Page 268</a>   He understood perfectly what His <b>love</b> was binding up in that institution and He gave thanks according to His own perfect apprehension of it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#268:18">Page 268</a>   The Lord gave thanks as Head; He had the perfect, intelligent apprehension of all that there was in His precious and holy body, which has been devoted in <b>love</b> for the assembly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#268:19">Page 268</a>   I do not know any type that comes nearer to it than that of the Hebrew servant; I think that is why brethren are so often led to refer to the one who said, "I <b>love</b> my master, my wife, and my children"<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#269:8">Page 269</a>   They could never forget the character of His <b>love</b>, how he devoted himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#269:9">Page 269</a>   That is how the Lord would have the assembly to remember Him as dedicated in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#269:11">Page 269</a>   He came into that body to devote it in <b>love</b> to the assembly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#270:3">Page 270</a>   To see the place of the loaf, as setting forth the Lord's body devoted in <b>love</b>, helps us to apprehend the character of the cup; it is what is conveyed in the thought of the new covenant.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#271:5">Page 271</a>   In the circle where His <b>love</b> is known intimately there may be found a treachery more dreadful than anything that could be found outside.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#271:12">Page 271</a>   Among those who know the Lord and have been intimate with all the expressions of His <b>love</b> there may arise a treachery that is more dreadful than anything that could be found outside.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#271:23">Page 271</a>   The more intimate our relations with the Lord -- and the relations of Judas with the Lord were very intimate -- the more He feels what is untrue to Himself, and what is utterly wanting in <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#272:2">Page 272</a>   The Lord allowed it in order to show that the flesh in the most wonderful privileges, in the greatest intimacy and in the most touching circumstances, is not at all affected by the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#272:3">Page 272</a>   That is my flesh, for Judas is in every one of us, a man who is unaffected by the most precious and most tender disclosures of the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#272:9">Page 272</a>   This comes out in different ways; here it comes out in the most intimate circle of divine <b>love</b> -- the treachery of Judas, the self-importance that was striving as to who should be greatest, and the self-confidence of Simon -- all these elements were there and the Lord lets us know that He knew it, but it is to bring us into complete harmony with Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#272:16">Page 272</a>   The darkest treachery that Satan can introduce into the inner circle of the Lord's <b>love</b> cannot interfere for a moment with God's designs: "the Son of man goes as it was determined".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#273:17">Page 273</a>   He gave Himself for the assembly that He might sanctify and purify it by the washing of water by the word, and there is no moment when He does it more than at the moment when His own <b>love</b> is so distinctly brought before us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#274:1">Page 274</a>   He reminds us that His is a sanctifying and purifying <b>love</b>, as well as a nourishing and cherishing <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#274:11">Page 274</a>   He shows Himself and there is positive gain; He displaces me and I <b>love</b> Him more than myself I look at myself and see hideous deformity; I look at Him and see surpassing excellence, glory and perfection that exceed my power to compass.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#276:2">Page 276</a>   The Lord in His <b>love</b> saw that it was necessary for Simon to be put into Satan's sieve and sifted, and He prayed for him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#282:18">Page 282</a>   It was Peter's genuine <b>love</b> for the Lord that brought him into danger, because he was not with God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#289:6">Page 289</a>   In John it is not so much this aspect of the shame of the cross, but the elevation of it as the way that divine <b>love</b> and power would take to accomplish God's blessed end.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#292:9">Page 292</a>   The <b>love</b> of God was poured out.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#292:11">Page 292</a>   It is quite in keeping to speak of His shedding His blood; He came in view of that pouring out; it was an act of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#292:13">Page 292</a>   The shedding of blood was an act of <b>love</b> on the part of God and on the part of Christ, just as it is in divine <b>love</b> that the Spirit is poured out, and it is poured out so that the <b>love</b> displayed at Calvary should be diffused in millions of human hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#298:11">Page 298</a>   The living One is moving in the service of grace and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#298:15">Page 298</a>   There may be true <b>love</b>, as there was in Peter and in these two disciples going to Emmaus, but in going to their own circle their movements were not governed by affection for Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#300:7">Page 300</a>   In spite of the terrible state of things in the Christian profession, there are unlimited possibilities for hearts that <b>love</b> the Lord; but then what we get individually is to qualify us for our position in relation to the brethren.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#300:19">Page 300</a>   There is no New Testament writer so individual as John, and yet there is no writer that so insists that we should <b>love</b> one another.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#308:12">Page 308</a>   We are to think of the exceeding sweetness of the <b>love</b> that would suffer so much.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#308:13">Page 308</a>   The Lord is cherished in His suffering <b>love</b>, but that means that we are perfectly free from all thought of ourselves.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#308:14">Page 308</a>   We are not thinking so much of what the Lord did  for us , but we are thinking of the path of unmeasured sorrow and suffering which He traversed in order to bring to us the grace and <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac10.htm#310:17">Page 310</a>  Then the honeycomb represents what the saints are in mutual <b>love</b> and activity.<br>
<h3>Volume 11 - An Outline of Romans</h3>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#11:9">Page 11</a>   There is a general and universal <b>love</b> of God, "The kindness and <b>love</b> to man of our Saviour God appeared",  Titus 3:4 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#11:11">Page 11</a>   He is truly the great Philanthropist; He loves man, and the proof of His <b>love</b> is that He has provided salvation for man through Jesus Christ, His mercy comes in to save man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#18:12">Page 18</a>   Salvation includes being invested with moral beauty through the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, so that we may appear "Like Thee in faith, in meekness, <b>love</b>,  In every beauteous grace".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#20:3">Page 20</a>   But when the kindness and <b>love</b> to man of our Saviour God appeared, not on the principle of works which have been done in righteousness which we had done, but according to his own mercy he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, which he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour"  Titus 3:3  - 6.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#20:4">Page 20</a>   As saved he walked in righteousness, holiness, and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#20:5">Page 20</a>   "<b>Love</b> works no ill to its neighbour: <b>love</b> therefore is the whole law",  Romans 13:10 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#25:4">Page 25</a>   If we do not know the righteousness of God thus there can be no solid peace, and no true enjoyment of the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#26:1">Page 26</a>   We need to have the truth of this deeply laid in our souls in these days when men have such loose and human thoughts of mercy, grace, and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#26:4">Page 26</a>   If men speak or think of the <b>love</b> of God in such a way as to lose sight of the reality of His wrath they hold the truth in unrighteousness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#26:5">Page 26</a>   The fact is that His <b>love</b> is known through His beloved Son having come as Man to drink the unspeakable cup of atoning sorrows, and to bear the wrath due to unrighteousness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#46:15">Page 46</a>   Obedience is the test of everything; the Lord insists in  John 14  that it is the test of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#53:2">Page 53</a>   A servant of the Lord said that there was nothing like the <b>love</b> of God to break a sinner down, but that the righteousness of God must be the foundation of all true building up.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#56:3">Page 56</a>   God says by the prophet Hosea, "I drew them with bands of a man, with cords of <b>love</b>",  Hosea 11:4 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#64:7">Page 64</a>   Do we not <b>love</b> to think of Him, to believe on Him, in that character?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#83:5">Page 83</a>   "Hope does not make ashamed, because the <b>love</b> of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#84:6">Page 84</a>   This is far too great a gift to be the result of anything less than the <b>love</b> of God, and the infinite value of the death of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#84:7">Page 84</a>   And this Gift is given that the <b>love</b> of God may be shed abroad in our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#84:9">Page 84</a>   Only a divine Person could pour out into the hearts of believers the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#84:10">Page 84</a>   God would be known in His <b>love</b> in the hearts of men.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#84:12">Page 84</a>  The Holy Spirit would direct us to the death of Christ as the great and blessed witness of God's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#84:15">Page 84</a>   But in the verses now before us that death is seen in the witness which it bears to the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#84:16">Page 84</a>   They speak of the penalty of death its borne by One who came under it in the <b>love</b> of God<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#85:4">Page 85</a>   It was pure <b>love</b> on God's part that He should do so.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#85:5">Page 85</a>   Can we think of all that Christ was to God, in the fragrance and power of what He was as God's Anointed, without having a sense of what God has given up in <b>love</b> when that Blessed One came under the penalty of death for the ungodly?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#85:11">Page 85</a>   But He died for the ungodly -- for us -- and God commends  His  <b>love</b> to us in that supreme sacrifice, that amazing surrender.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#85:12">Page 85</a>   The <b>love</b> of God was concentrated in that wondrous act, the death of Christ, but for nearly two thousand years it has been diffused in millions of hearts by the Holy Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#85:13">Page 85</a>   God has made the utmost sacrifice possible that we might know His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#85:14">Page 85</a>   The coming in of the penalty of death declared the utter ruin of the creature, but God has made that penalty the eternal witness of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#85:15">Page 85</a>   The <b>love</b> of God expressed in the death of Christ is the most amazing thing in the universe; it can never be fathomed; and it is now being poured out into the hearts of believers by the Holy Spirit<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#86:2">Page 86</a>   God's wondrous thought is that His <b>love</b> should become the life of stir hearts so that it might circulate through our whole moral being, Natural life is in the blood, but the very essence of spiritual life is the <b>love</b> of God known in the heart by the Holy Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#86:7">Page 86</a>  Having the <b>love</b> of God shed abroad in our hearts, and having been justified in the power of the blood of Christ, we have a wonderful outlook.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#86:10">Page 86</a>   Justified persons, knowing the <b>love</b> of God, are assured that they will be saved by Christ from wrath.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#87:11">Page 87</a>   Such is His tender interest and faithful <b>love</b>, in regard to the justified, that they will be saved  by Him  from wrath.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#88:10">Page 88</a>   It has been effected by the Son of the Father's <b>love</b>: "we have been reconciled to God through the death of his Son".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#89:1">Page 89</a>   The whole condition of enmity which was before God has been taken up by One who knew every necessity of divine <b>love</b> -- for it was "his Son" -- and He died to secure that we should be reconciled.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#92:12">Page 92</a>   Under His administration we come into peace, favour, the gift of the Spirit, the <b>love</b> of God, reconciliation, and are able to make our boast in God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#92:18">Page 92</a>  These two great subjects of reconciliation and the knowledge of God in the <b>love</b> revealed in the new covenant are continuously brought before us in the Lord's supper<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#93:4">Page 93</a>   How pleasurable it was to Him to contemplate the frequent recurrence of the saints doing that which brings the <b>love</b> of God before them!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#104:13">Page 104</a>   He is baptised in the cloud as under the blessed favour of God, and the Holy Spirit is in his heart shedding the <b>love</b> of God abroad there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#105:12">Page 105</a>   The Lord Jesus Christ is now magnified before my heart; I begin to appreciate and <b>love</b> obedience as seen in Him, for all my blessing has come through it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#113:3">Page 113</a>    He  came into contact with sin on the line of obedience, and His contact with it personally and sacrificially cost Him unspeakable sorrow and suffering, but it was all undergone in <b>love</b> to His God and Father, and in <b>love</b> to us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#113:4">Page 113</a>   The principle of disobedience cost Him everything that <b>love</b> could suffer.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#113:7">Page 113</a>   My impression is that this is a matter of  <b>love</b> .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#113:8">Page 113</a>   "Knowing" in verse 6 is a matter of  faith , but it is only  <b>love</b>  that can "reckon" as in verse 11.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#113:11">Page 113</a>   Nothing but  <b>love</b>  could have prompted such an utterance.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#113:23">Page 113</a>  Mephibosheth, too, illustrates how <b>love</b> would reckon<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#114:7">Page 114</a>  Now if Christ has died to sin -- and that is an undoubted fact -- it is our privilege, if we have <b>love</b> enough for Him to do it, to reckon ourselves "dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus".<br>

<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#114:9">Page 114</a>   Even the obedience of Christ flowed out of <b>love</b>.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#116:14">Page 116</a>   But suppose the reading of certain books takes one away practically from the enjoyment of the <b>love</b> of God, and robs one of present spiritual wealth in Christ, and of the comforting ministry of the Holy Spirit, is not that terrible bondage?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#117:7">Page 117</a>   No one could obey from the heart unless he had come under the powerful influence of grace, as leaving the knowledge of Christ and of the <b>love</b> of God sealed in his affections by the Holy Spirit.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#121:3">Page 121</a>   Not a husband like the law who claims but gives no support, but One whose <b>love</b> delights to be to us all that we need in companionship and support so that we may bring forth fruit to God!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#122:10">Page 122</a>   We are set in relation to One who is pledged in <b>love</b> to support us.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#123:7">Page 123</a>  It is at this point in the epistle that we come for the first time to the thought of the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#123:8">Page 123</a>   We have had the blessedness of Christ as the Mercy-seat and the Mediator, and the One through whose death the <b>love</b> of God has been made known to us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#123:10">Page 123</a>   But when the thought of Christ as Husband is suggested to us, as it is here, it brings Him to our side, and we come to learn experimentally the personal <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#123:11">Page 123</a>   The <b>love</b> of God and the <b>love</b> of Christ are the most profound and blessed things conceivable, and, thank God!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#123:14">Page 123</a>   Paul could speak of being constrained -- held -- by the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#123:16">Page 123</a>   May it take hold of our hearts that He loves our confidence, and would draw us into the embrace of His <b>love</b>, that He may give us His confidence as well as His unfailing support in every weakness!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#123:17">Page 123</a>  This is the way in which divine <b>love</b> would free our hearts, not only from the law as formally known, but from every element of that legality which is so rooted in the natural heart and mind of man<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#124:2">Page 124</a>   But how blessed it is to lay firmly hold of the thought of divine grace, that we have been made dead to the law by the body of Christ that we might be to Another -- to find in the <b>love</b> and support of Christ the full supply of all that our weakness needs; so that, instead of the passions of sins working in our members to bring forth fruit unto death, we are able to bear fruit to God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#130:14">Page 130</a>  The Holy Spirit is spoken of in chapter 5 as shedding abroad the <b>love</b> of God in our hearts, but at the beginning of chapter 8 He is the Spirit of life in a new order of Man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#135:12">Page 135</a>   But the law being "weak through the flesh", and unable to do what was needed, has given place to a wondrous action of divine <b>love</b>: "God, having sent his own Son".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#136:3">Page 136</a>    His own Son  should take it up; He would send Him "in likeness of flesh of sin" so that <b>love</b> might have its holy way even in relation to that dreadful order of being.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#136:9">Page 136</a>   It was the holy and unsparing condemnation of our flesh, hut it came about in a most, wondrous act of divine <b>love</b> to usward.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#136:19">Page 136</a>   He "has condemned sin in the flesh" absolutely, but He has done it by an action of <b>love</b>, so that He might be free to give us the Spirit as power to walk morally apart from the flesh<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#137:1">Page 137</a>   As we walk "according to Spirit" the righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled in us; we <b>love</b> God; and we <b>love</b> our neighbour, and work no ill to him, we are ready to serve him in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#147:5">Page 147</a>   It is not only that we receive sonship as a gift of divine <b>love</b>, according to  Galatians 4:5 , but that, as led by the Spirit, we move here as sons of God.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#149:2">Page 149</a>   We appreciate what is of God, it is sweet and delightful to us; we respond affectionately to His <b>love</b>, we have sensibilities and motives which show that we are begotten of Him.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#157:7">Page 157</a>   It is the recovery, through infinite, divine grace and <b>love</b>, of God's original purpose as set forth in  Genesis 1 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#157:10">Page 157</a>   The wealth of God, of which Christ is Heir, and of which we are Christ's joint-heirs, is the purpose and power of His <b>love</b> to remove from creation every trace of vanity and bondage, and to bring in the liberty of glory.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#158:4">Page 158</a>  God's sons and children <b>love</b> Him -- the whole epistle shows how He has acted to secure this -- and they are "called according to purpose".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#158:6">Page 158</a>   God never deviates from this purpose; He called us with this in view; and as He controls all things, "we  do  know that all things work together for good to those who <b>love</b> God".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#158:8">Page 158</a>   There is not a suffering connected with the present state of "the creature" which does not work for good to those who <b>love</b> God.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#162:13">Page 162</a>   Christ intercedes for us, not as creatures marked by sin and failure, but as the precious stones of the breastplate: each saint having his own distinctive lustre and beauty according to divine purpose, and set in gold, which would signify how we are set in the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#163:3">Page 163</a>  The experience of the <b>love</b> of Christ in tribulation or distress puts a very distinctive impression of Him upon the heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#163:6">Page 163</a>   I believe that the time of trial is the time when a distinctive impression of Christ and His <b>love</b> is put upon the believer.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#163:10">Page 163</a>  Then Christ is not only seen here as the blessed living Priest, active in the intercession of <b>love</b>, but the chapter closes by bringing Him before us as the Ark of the covenant.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#163:11">Page 163</a>   "The <b>love</b> of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#163:12">Page 163</a>   The covenant now is the revelation of God in <b>love</b>, and it is bound up with the fact that there is a Man who is in every way suited to that <b>love</b>.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#164:2">Page 164</a>   But the <b>love</b> of God is in a  Man , that it may be the portion of  men  now and eternally.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#164:6">Page 164</a>   And God would have each believer to be consciously persuaded even as Paul was: "For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall able to separate us from the <b>love</b> of God, which is Christ Jesus our Lord".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#165:3">Page 165</a>   His <b>love</b> for them had exceeded anything that was natural to man; it was a flame kindled from the <b>love</b> of Jehovah and of His Christ for the people of His choice.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#168:10">Page 168</a>   This is the purpose of His sovereign <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#173:14">Page 173</a>   This has no connection with law-righteousness; it is the mighty intervention of God in <b>love</b> and power, sending Christ down from heaven to be His salvation, and raising Him from among the dead when everything had been done that His glory required<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#180:6">Page 180</a>   God made known to His sinful creatures in grace, righteousness, power and <b>love</b>, through redemption, and through the Lord Jesus Christ as a risen and glorified Man!<br>

<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#202:6">Page 202</a>   But evil is injurious to saints, and therefore unfeigned <b>love</b> must abhor evil, because it is mischievous and destructive.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#202:7">Page 202</a>   <b>Love</b> is beneficent, and it cannot be complacent while its object is suffering from what is evil.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#202:17">Page 202</a>   If evil appears in a believer, we must never forget that Christ has borne in <b>love</b> the judgment due to it.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#203:4">Page 203</a>   Brotherly <b>love</b> would take account of all the conditions and circumstances in which the brethren are found, and would be affectionately concerned about them, as to their families, their health, or their business.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#221:12">Page 221</a>   This puts in a very strong light the tender care which <b>love</b> would take to do everything possible to further the work of God, and nothing to hinder it.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#224:6">Page 224</a>   An allusion to what Christ was personally is always very appealing to those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#227:11">Page 227</a>   A natural man could point out defects: a spiritual man feels under obligation to serve in <b>love</b> that they may be removed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#228:8">Page 228</a>   While keeping our hearts open towards all saints, our associations have now to be adjusted on the principle of withdrawing from iniquity, separating from vessels to dishonour, following righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace, and calling upon the Lord out of a pure heart.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac11.htm#245:4">Page 245</a>   It was a secret reserved in the wisdom of God for the present time, bringing out by its revelation the utmost depths and heights of divine wisdom and <b>love</b>, and the blessedness of God's eternal purpose which He purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br>
<h3>Volume 12 - An Outline of the Epistle of James</h3>
<a href="../cac/cac12.htm#7:12">Page 7</a>   If knowledge is not used in wisdom and <b>love</b> we may stumble the very persons we want to help.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac12.htm#8:2">Page 8</a>   If there is "burning heat" to wither what is of the flesh, there is the beneficent light of God revealed in <b>love</b>, giving every good and perfect gift.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac12.htm#8:5">Page 8</a>   "Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for, having been proved, he shall receive the crown of life, which He has promised to them that <b>love</b> Him".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac12.htm#8:12">Page 8</a>   The testings to which we are subjected bring out the fact that the saints <b>love</b> God, and it is such who receive the crown of life.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac12.htm#9:6">Page 9</a>  It is most important that we should have the upward look of appreciation for those things which are the fruit of the revelation of God in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac12.htm#9:12">Page 9</a>   To be outside the activities and giving of divine <b>love</b> is death morally.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac12.htm#9:13">Page 9</a>  Then in sovereign <b>love</b> God has begotten us by the word of truth.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac12.htm#10:4">Page 10</a>   If God had not exercised His own will in sovereign <b>love</b> none of us would have had a bit of appreciation of Christ, or desire to move after Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac12.htm#12:4">Page 12</a>   God in sovereign <b>love</b>, by an act of His own will, has brought forth a generation who are firstfruits of His creatures; they are brought into evidence now.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac12.htm#14:7">Page 14</a>  Every claim of God in <b>love</b> has been seen as perfectly answered to by a blessed Man in this world; all the divine pleasure has been exemplified in One who ever responded in a Son's affections to God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac12.htm#15:1">Page 15</a>  We are going to be judged by the fact that divine <b>love</b> has set us up with capability to do the will of God, and to have firstfruits character.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac12.htm#33:8">Page 33</a>   He is known in the shining forth of His <b>love</b> and goodness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac12.htm#37:2">Page 37</a>   We are privileged to look at the suffering that comes upon us all in different ways in the light of the <b>love</b> and tender compassion that is behind it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac12.htm#38:1">Page 38</a>   Refining and adjusting is always going on in the Lord's faithful <b>love</b> in view of His coming.<br>
<h3>Volume 13 - An Outline of "The Revelation"</h3>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#2:10">Page 2</a>  But, in truth, it is a most encouraging book for all who fear God and who <b>love</b> our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#3:8">Page 3</a>   Hearts touched by the <b>love</b> of Jesus Christ, and by the way that <b>love</b> expressed itself in death, and by the consciousness of the wonderful position in which that <b>love</b> has set us as priests to His God and Father, must take a deep and intelligent interest in all that He has to communicate.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#4:8">Page 4</a>   And then, as we pass on through the book, to see different families of saints coming into view, called by divine grace and sustained in divine witness amidst terrible and appalling conditions, is most stimulating to faith and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#5:5">Page 5</a>   He represents those holy and living affections which can be sustained all through in spite of church failure, and which can be found at the end in full response to the <b>love</b> of Christ -- the Coming One.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#6:5">Page 6</a>   One, too, who awakens by the sense of what He has done for us in <b>love</b> the responsive affections and praises of every heart that knows Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#10:9">Page 10</a>   Their relations with one another as walking together in truth and <b>love</b> and holiness and unity, in complete separation from the world, would be such as to support the testimony of divine grace, and to preserve true witness to a rejected Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#12:3">Page 12</a>   John had known Him in other ways; in the attractiveness of His walk as the Lamb of God; in all the varied blessedness of the ministry in word and deed which flowed out of that fulness of grace and truth which resided in Him; in the service of His <b>love</b> when He had stooped to wash His disciples' feet; and in those intimacies of holy affection which made him so conscious that he was "the disciple whom Jesus loved".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#13:11">Page 13</a>   None of them departed from first <b>love</b>; they were sustained in freshness and spiritual energy to the very end of their responsible course.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#18:7">Page 18</a>   The presence and activity of "first <b>love</b>" are essential, so that if that is gone the position of the "lamp" is forfeited.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#18:11">Page 18</a>   "I have against thee that thou hast left thy first <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#19:3">Page 19</a>   Their first <b>love</b> had been left.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#19:4">Page 19</a>   "First <b>love</b>" is a thing which we ought all to be very much exercised about; we may never have known what it really is.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#19:6">Page 19</a>   "Thy first <b>love</b>" is not the brightness and zeal which may often be found in a young convert, but it is <b>love</b> of an assembly character.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#19:8">Page 19</a>   My impression is that "first <b>love</b>" is that character of <b>love</b> to which Christ gave impulse amongst His own at the beginning.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#19:9">Page 19</a>   He said, "A new commandment I give to you, that ye <b>love</b> one another; as I have loved you, that ye also <b>love</b> one another.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#19:10">Page 19</a>   By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have <b>love</b> amongst yourselves" ( John 13:34 , 35).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#19:12">Page 19</a>   It is the result of coming under the powerful and personal influence of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#19:13">Page 19</a>  The assembly's "first <b>love</b>" was when the Head was held in affection, and the saints abiding in Him were engaged in activities to which His <b>love</b> gave impulse.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#19:15">Page 19</a>   "That the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts, being rooted and founded in <b>love</b>, in order that ye may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height; and to know the <b>love</b> of the Christ which surpasses knowledge; that ye may be filled even to all the fulness of God"<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#20:1">Page 20</a>  It must have been beautiful under the eye of the Lord to see a company "holding the truth in <b>love</b>" and growing "up to him in all things, who is the head, the Christ: from whom the whole body, fitted together, and connected by every joint of supply, according to the working in its measure of each one part, works for itself the increase of the body to its self-building up in <b>love</b>" ( Ephesians 4:15 , 16).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#20:2">Page 20</a>   I think that gives the character of "first works" which go along with "first <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#20:6">Page 20</a>   It is great divine favour -- though it is very humbling -- to see what the assembly was in first <b>love</b> and first works.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#20:8">Page 20</a>   The assembly has left its first <b>love</b> and is fallen, but it is still possible for us to hold the Head and to grow up to Him, and to get supply and impulse from Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#20:10">Page 20</a>   And as saints have nourishment ministered to them, and are knit together in <b>love</b>, there may be found even in the closing days a measure of return to "first <b>love</b>"<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#21:11">Page 21</a>  When the assembly got away from her first <b>love</b> she ceased to do the first works, and the Lord had to say that if she did not repent He would remove her lamp out of its place.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#24:5">Page 24</a>   The assembly had left its first <b>love</b>; it had ceased to hold fast the Head; and though many spiritual activities remained they had not the character of first works; they did not get their impulse from living contact of affection with Christ as Head.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#26:11">Page 26</a>   "First <b>love</b>" would hold everything in living connection with Christ the Head, but departure from that leads to giving man after the flesh a place<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#34:2">Page 34</a>  In Ephesus, though there was as yet no public defection, under the Lord's eye first <b>love</b> had been left; then in Pergamos there was public departure -- the assembly dwelling in the world and having corrupters within; now in Thyatira we find Jezebel permitted and those in the assembly who were her children.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#34:5">Page 34</a>   "<b>Love</b>, and faith, and service, and thine endurance, and thy last works to be more than the first".<br>

<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#38:9">Page 38</a>   The assembly, His bride, the subject of His <b>love</b> (in which He gave Himself for her, and sanctified and cleansed her by the washing of water by the word) presented to Himself a glorious assembly with no trace of imperfection or decay upon her, reigning with Him to shed abroad in beneficent influence all that she learned of Him by the Spirit while He was hidden in the heavens.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#46:3">Page 46</a>   Nothing but completeness will satisfy Him, nor will it really satisfy those who <b>love</b> Him and care for His interests.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#52:8">Page 52</a>   And as saints take this up together in the <b>love</b> of the brethren there is that under the eye of the Lord which has the original features of the assembly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#53:3">Page 53</a>   In whatever character we think of Him -- and how innumerable are the forms of <b>love</b>, wisdom, grace and power which He wears!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#55:1">Page 55</a>   Though He is no longer here personally He is here in the confession of His Name by the brethren who <b>love</b> one another.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#58:7">Page 58</a>   It requires individual overcomers to  hold together in the <b>love</b> of the brethren  the precious things which we have spoken of.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#58:9">Page 58</a>   It is a condition that can only be maintained in the energy of spiritual affections to which Christ is pre-eminent, and by which the assembly, and all that relates to it, is cherished because it is the subject of the <b>love</b> of Christ, and all is held in the <b>love</b> of the brethren.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#58:11">Page 58</a>   But at any rate we can allow our desires to be formed by this precious utterance of our Lord, and we can pray that it may increasingly characterize us as seeking to walk with our brethren in truth and <b>love</b>.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#62:5">Page 62</a>   It is His distinctive glory to be the Accomplisher of all the Father's eternal purposes of <b>love</b>.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#67:1">Page 67</a>   We may well pray, as we sometimes do: -  "O kindle within us a holy desire,  Like that which was found in Thy people of old,  Who tasted Thy <b>love</b>, and whose hearts were on fire,  While they waited, in patience, Thy face to behold".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#69:7">Page 69</a>  It is very striking that the Lord should speak of His <b>love</b> to such an assembly as Laodicea.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#69:9">Page 69</a>   He speaks as a Lover still, but it is <b>love</b> that cannot be complacent; things are such that His <b>love</b> can only be active in the way of rebuke and discipline.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#70:6">Page 70</a>   He is still faithful to His own <b>love</b>; He still rebukes and disciplines in a thousand ways; and it is not simply that He knocks once or twice and retires, but He has placed Himself at the door and continues knocking, and He will do so until that moment when the catching up of the saints will involve the utter rejection by Him of Laodicea.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#71:10">Page 71</a>  John is very individual, but no one emphasizes more than John <b>love</b> to one another, <b>love</b> to the brethren, and the family links and affections of the children of God.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#105:1">Page 105</a>   1 Thessalonians shows how saints of this period have "turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God", and that they are "sons of light and sons of day", and are therefore to put on "the breastplate of faith and <b>love</b>, and as helmet the hope of salvation".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#110:6">Page 110</a>   It is precious to know that the Lamb will have such a flock to shepherd, and such a blessed service of <b>love</b> to render that flock.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#179:17">Page 179</a>   And this is peculiarly obnoxious to God, as coming in after the full revelation of Himself in His Son, and after the gift of His Spirit to shed His <b>love</b> abroad in the hearts of believers.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#193:5">Page 193</a>   The assembly is cherished in the heart of Christ according to all the thoughts of divine <b>love</b>, and if we have seen what it is as cherished there it will make us very jealous in regard of corrupting influences.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac13.htm#194:10">Page 194</a>   Paul corrects that by exhorting them to follow after  <b>love</b> , which would not think of distinction for self, but of the good of others.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#3:16">Page 3</a>   I answer, it is the boundless <b>love</b> of the heart of God going out to sinners, and acting for their blessing though they deserve nothing but judgment.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#3:17">Page 3</a>   But divine <b>love</b> must be a righteous and holy <b>love</b>, and God would not clear away our sins in an unrighteous way.<br>

From verse 35 to the end of the chapter, every kind of trial and suffering is marshalled before us -- everything that the power of evil could bring upon us is brought forward, only to establish the glorious truth that none of these things, nor all of them together, can separate the believer from the <b>love</b> of Christ, or from the <b>love</b> of God which is in Christ Jesus<br>
<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#16:4">Page 16</a>   No <b>love</b> of selfish case, no supine and carnal indulgence, retarded his movements.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#17:3">Page 17</a>   The words are twice repeated in  Genesis 22 , "they went  both of them together ", and in the deepest way was this true of God and His beloved Son as They moved on together in that wondrous path of divine <b>love</b> which ended at the cross.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#17:20">Page 17</a>   We see at the cross the infinite holiness of God in His judgment of our sins; but we see that judgment failing upon One who bears it in voluntary self-sacrifice and devoted <b>love</b>, in order that we may be justified and have Peace with God<br>

<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#20:15">Page 20</a>   His devotedness to God, and His <b>love</b> to the Father, were never so expressed as when He gave Himself for us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#20:17">Page 20</a>  "<b>Love</b> that on death's dark vale Its sweetest odours spread;  Where sin o'er all seemed to prevail, Redemption's glory shed".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#25:21">Page 25</a>   It is brought to view in these words of Paul: "For the <b>love</b> of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again",  2 Corinthians 5:14 , 15.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#25:24">Page 25</a>   But wondrous <b>love</b> is there as well as holy judgment.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#26:3">Page 26</a>   If I gaze on that scene I learn my utter worthlessness and unfitness for God, but I find  <b>love</b>  there that wins my heart.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#26:7">Page 26</a>   To observe legal ordinances and to keep up ceremonial distinctions might be an object to others --  they  might wish to retain Ishmael: but the motive object of  Paul's  life was a Person whose <b>love</b> to Paul had carried Him unto death, and that Person THE SON OF GOD.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#28:9">Page 28</a>  "<b>Love</b> not the world", says the Holy Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#32:10">Page 32</a>   The child of Adam, as such, breaks God's law and despises God's grace; divine <b>love</b> fails to reach his heart, and divine light upon his conscience only drives him behind the trees of the garden, as in Eden, or away from its searching scrutiny, as in  John 8 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#34:1">Page 34</a>   Having taken such a place in deep, divine <b>love</b>, all the desert and consequence of sin must needs come upon Him.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#39:4">Page 39</a>   All the counsels of eternal <b>love</b> will have their full fruition in a coming day, when Adam will be superseded by Christ PHYSICALLY,  FOR WE SHALL HAVE BODIES LIKE HIS.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#42:18">Page 42</a>   If we have learned with God that from the core to the circumference of our being there is not a sound spot in us, but that we are utterly under condemnation and death, it is blessed to find that the counsels of eternal <b>love</b> have purposed such an acceptance for us<br>
<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#43:9">Page 43</a>   God would have our souls in the joy of this wonderful position; He would have us by His spirit free and happy in the joy of <b>love</b> that gives us such an acceptance.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#43:11">Page 43</a>  But there is something else indicated in the second verse of our chapter, where we find the Bridegroom's reply, "As the lily among thorns, so is my <b>love</b> among the daughters".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#44:5">Page 44</a>   The blessed One who has entered into the rest and joy of the Father's presence has His treasure -- the objects of His <b>love</b> -- in this world, and we can neither express nor conceive the delight of His <b>love</b> even in such a company of "his own" as are here tonight.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#44:6">Page 44</a>   He can say of us now, in the joy of what we are to Him, "As the lily among thorns, so is my <b>love</b> among the daughters".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#44:11">Page 44</a>   We were in the Father's purpose as a company worthy to be given to the Son as the expression of the Father's <b>love</b> to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#44:13">Page 44</a>  But another marvellous display of divine <b>love</b> was necessary before we could be "his own".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#44:15">Page 44</a>   The purposes of sovereign <b>love</b> could only be carried out on the ground of redemption and the full maintenance of the divine glory in respect to sin, and to accomplish this the good Shepherd laid down His life for the sheep.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#44:20">Page 44</a>   The Father, too, acts in divine power, and <b>love</b> to the same end.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#45:4">Page 45</a>   The very best thing that the deep <b>love</b> of His heart could think of for us is that we should have part with Him in that wonderful circle with the Father.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#45:5">Page 45</a>   To this end He serves in active <b>love</b> with a view to remove every spot and stain that would unfit us for part with Him.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#48:5">Page 48</a>   The banqueting house was the place of royal pleasure -- the place where the king had his own delights -- and it was in that place that his <b>love</b> was known by the bride.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#48:13">Page 48</a>   Can you say that the Lord has brought you to such a place -- even to His own banqueting house and beneath the banner of His <b>love</b>?<br>

<a href="../cac/cac15.htm#60:10">Page 60</a>   He loves to think of the spotless perfection of the Victim, of the <b>love</b> that made Him willing to bear the judgment, and of the infinite value of that divine work which has exhausted for ever the judgment under which he lay.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#13:1">Page 13</a>   The <b>love</b> that reaches us through death is an everlasting <b>love</b>, and it is the sure pledge of our salvation from wrath.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#14:2">Page 14</a>   The best robe did not produce any change in the father, it did not add to the father's <b>love</b>, but it changed everything on the prodigal's side.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#17:6">Page 17</a>  Second, God's  <b>love</b>  is commanded "toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us" ( Romans 5:8 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#17:13">Page 17</a>  It is in the fact that Christ has died for us when sinners that God commends to us a <b>love</b> peculiar to Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#17:14">Page 17</a>   For <b>love</b> like this cannot he found in any creature.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#17:15">Page 17</a>   Human <b>love</b> is often used as an illustration of divine <b>love</b>, but in truth human illustrations utterly fail to set forth the quality and character of God's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#17:16">Page 17</a>   To apprehend that <b>love</b> one must realise the relative positions of God and His creature man; one must take into account what sin is before God and the state into which it has brought man; one must see the greatness of the blessed Person, who came here in flesh that He might die for ungodly sinners.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#17:17">Page 17</a>   Christ has come under all that to which we were liable that the <b>love</b> of God might reach us in blessing, and His death is the commendation of that <b>love</b> to us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#17:18">Page 17</a>   <b>Love</b> has expressed itself in the utmost self-sacrifice, and this in a divine Person who has died to remove from before God in judgment all that we were as sinners<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#18:1">Page 18</a>   Who would not praise this perfect and holy <b>love</b>?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#19:1">Page 19</a>   It is not that we believe something about ourselves, but we believe on God who has made Himself known by the Lord Jesus Christ in righteousness, <b>love</b>, power, and grace as a Saviour God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#21:14">Page 21</a>   We see Man devoted in <b>love</b> to the will of God; we see One who could and did maintain everything for God's good pleasure at all cost to Himself; in a word, we see righteousness<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#32:5">Page 32</a>   God has prepared wondrous things for those who <b>love</b> Him -- things which the human mind cannot comprehend -- and eternal life is found in the knowledge and enjoyment of those blessed things.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#32:6">Page 32</a>   If God has satisfied us with His goodness and grace, it is that we might <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#32:7">Page 32</a>   And if we <b>love</b> Him we shall desire above all things to know Him in the circle of His own thoughts and delights.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#35:1">Page 35</a>  But one may say, "The very fact that divine perfection has come into this world in Christ only serves to make more manifest my utter depravity and helplessness, for I am totally unable to take one step after Him in His pathway of holy obedience and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#35:11">Page 35</a>   In the death of Christ we see the penalty and curse of a broken law coming upon One who placed Himself under it in perfect divine grace and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#36:17">Page 36</a>   By giving them the knowledge of Himself, and making them conscious of His company, His <b>love</b>, and His support, He brought them into liberty.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#37:2">Page 37</a>   What a pledge of His <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#37:3">Page 37</a>   May we not count upon all His power and resources being for us, since His <b>love</b> toward us knows no reserve?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#37:4">Page 37</a>   By going into death He has put the seal of His <b>love</b> for ever on our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#37:14">Page 37</a>   We abide in Him as we are conscious of our weakness on the one hand, and of His <b>love</b> and power on the other.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#38:14">Page 38</a>  God would have us to be so assured of the <b>love</b> and support of Christ that we should think more of the support and the supply than of the claim.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#43:8">Page 43</a>   This brings us morally into an entirely new region where, in the presence of God's goodness and <b>love</b>, we are free from the controlling power of sin, and the condemnation that attaches to the flesh in which sin works.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#44:14">Page 44</a>   His grace, His faithfulness, His <b>love</b>, His wonderful works, His counsels and purposes are ever before the mind of the Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#46:6">Page 46</a>   As we are led by the Spirit of God we get morally detached from the flesh, and separated from the world; we are formed in spiritual affections so as to respond to the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#46:7">Page 46</a>   We find ourselves the happy subjects of God's holy <b>love</b>, and as we live in that <b>love</b> we cry, "Abba, Father".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#46:9">Page 46</a>  THE <b>LOVE</b> OF GOD Romans 8:15  - 39 The great theme that underlies this chapter is the <b>love</b> of God -- that sovereign <b>love</b> towards His elect in which He has taken them up for His own pleasure, and according to which He ever regards them and acts for them<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#47:1">Page 47</a>   God's purposes are the outcome of His <b>love</b>, and all that He does  for  His saints, and  in  them -- all His ways  with  them -- is the activity of that sovereign <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#47:3">Page 47</a>  God has in <b>love</b> appropriated a people for Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#47:4">Page 47</a>   He could say of old to Israel, "Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting <b>love</b>; therefore with loving- kindness have I drawn thee" ( Jeremiah 31:3 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#47:5">Page 47</a>   And again, "I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of <b>love</b>; .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#47:10">Page 47</a>   And if God is pleased to set His <b>love</b> upon His saints, we may be sure that He will prove Himself to he more than a match for all the power of evil.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#48:7">Page 48</a>   He would keep our imperfections and our weakness so before us as to hinder us from perceiving the perfect grace and <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#48:11">Page 48</a>   Indeed, the truth is that when I was in the worst possible state -- without strength, ungodly, a sinner, and an enemy of God -- He expressed His <b>love</b> towards me in the most wonderful way that could be conceived ( Romans 5:6  - 8).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#49:10">Page 49</a>   They "were under the cloud" ( 1 Corinthians 10:1 ); that is, in figure, overshadowed by the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#49:11">Page 49</a>  "The <b>love</b> of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us" ( Romans 5:5 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#49:12">Page 49</a>   The great positive blessing conferred upon those who believe the gospel is the gift of the Spirit, and by the Spirit God's <b>love</b> is shed abroad in our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#49:14">Page 49</a>   For "there is no fear in <b>love</b>; but perfect <b>love</b> casteth out fear; because fear hath torment.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#49:15">Page 49</a>   He that feareth is not made perfect in <b>love</b>" ( 1 John 4:18 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#49:16">Page 49</a>   God's banner over us is <b>love</b>, and the Spirit gives us the consciousness of it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#49:20">Page 49</a>   All the <b>love</b> expressed in the death of Christ is towards you, and when you see that you can do nothing, and that you are nothing but an ungodly and helpless sinner, you will be prepared to receive that <b>love</b> into your heart<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#50:1">Page 50</a>   It is self-sufficiency and self-occupation, or, perhaps, self-gratification, that hinders the Holy Spirit from pouring the <b>love</b> of God into your heart -- that blessed <b>love</b> which flows out of its own fulness and finds in the very guilt and state of its subjects an opportunity to manifest itself in the most glorious way.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#50:6">Page 50</a>   I have no doubt this was the time referred to in  Jeremiah 2:2 , "I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the <b>love</b> of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#50:8">Page 50</a>   Knowing the <b>love</b> of God we are in liberty, and there is response to that <b>love</b> in our hearts by the Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#50:9">Page 50</a>   The <b>love</b> of God is poured into our hearts, and it forms affections there that flow back to their Source.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#50:15">Page 50</a>   And now that we have been appropriated by the <b>love</b> of God we have to recognise this<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#51:17">Page 51</a>  As a result of the Spirit's intercession we obtain help of God, so that, amidst our sufferings and weakness, we have the consciousness that "all things work together for good to them that <b>love</b> God, to them who are the called according to his purpose".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#52:1">Page 52</a>   God is always for us in the <b>love</b> which moved Him to spare not His own Son, but to deliver Him up for us all.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#52:2">Page 52</a>   Hence it is in the very nature of things that they should work together for good to them that <b>love</b> God, for His hand is over everything in power and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#52:13">Page 52</a>   To be nourished by the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#52:14">Page 52</a>   That infinite and blessed <b>love</b> which has reached down even to death, and which is now active at the right hand of God where He makes intercession for us, is the divine Source of all our strength for conflict here.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#53:1">Page 53</a>   Christ is in the place of power on high, but He is there to make intercession for us, and nothing can separate us from His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#54:7">Page 54</a>   Every thought of God's mind has failed of accomplishment in man after the order of Adam, but all the thoughts and purposes of His <b>love</b> have been established in Christ Jesus.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#54:9">Page 54</a>   As saints -- God's elect -- we are of that Man and in Him, and thus we come under the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#54:10">Page 54</a>  No creature can dispossess God's saints of their blessing in Christ Jesus, or separate them "from the <b>love</b> of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#54:11">Page 54</a>   We are blessed in the Man of God's counsel, and in Him we come under the <b>love</b> of God and are bound up with it for ever.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#54:12">Page 54</a>  May our hearts be affected and subdued by the <b>love</b> of God!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#54:13">Page 54</a>   The true blessedness of the Christian lies in the knowledge of that holy <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#54:14">Page 54</a>   "I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the <b>love</b> of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#55:7">Page 55</a>   This leads up to the result that there are those on earth who have God's <b>love</b> shed abroad in their hearts, and who are responsive to that <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#55:8">Page 55</a>   They <b>love</b> God, and they cry, in affection, "Abba, Father".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#55:9">Page 55</a>   Now the question arises, Who are they who thus know God and respond to His holy <b>love</b>?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#58:7">Page 58</a>  In view of all the way in which God has wrought to set aside and bring to nothing the boasting, conceit, high-mindedness, and self-righteousness of man in the flesh -- in view, too, of the sovereign mercy in which He gives effect to the purposes of His <b>love</b> -- one cannot wonder that the apostle breaks out in the doxology with which chapter 11 closes.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#59:6">Page 59</a>   If all that has gone before in this epistle -- the infinite grace, <b>love</b>, and mercy of God -- has in any way got into our hearts, it must have prepared us to respond fully and gladly to this appeal.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#59:7">Page 59</a>   If God has built up the knowledge of grace in our souls, and shed his <b>love</b> abroad in our hearts -- if He has bowed our spirits in adoring praise for His sovereign mercy to us -- surely the effect of all this must he that we desire to be here for His will and pleasure.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#59:8">Page 59</a>   We are prompted in this holy desire by every motive with which divine <b>love</b> could furnish our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#62:12">Page 62</a>   Finally,  <b>love</b>  is to be the all-pervading spirit of our intercourse with the saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac16.htm#62:13">Page 62</a>   Unfeigned <b>love</b> and kindly affection one towards another will enable us in honour to prefer one another; it will move us to distribute to the necessity of saints, and to be hospitable; it will enable us to rejoice with those that rejoice and to weep with those that weep.<br>
<h3>Volume 17 - The Food of Life</h3>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#3:1">Page 3</a>   "Herein as to us has been manifested the <b>love</b> of God, that God has sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#3:2">Page 3</a>   The <b>love</b> of God would have us to live for His pleasure through the death of His Son, but for this His flesh must be eaten, His blood drunk.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#3:8">Page 3</a>   The flesh and blood of the Son of man show the length to which the <b>love</b> of God would go in order that we might have our part in the life in which Christ now lives as risen from among the dead, and ascended up where He was before.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#3:19">Page 3</a>   It is life according to the blessed thought of the <b>love</b> of God<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#4:8">Page 4</a>   They are divine <b>love</b> in manifestation, but now appropriated and assimilated as the way by which that <b>love</b> reaches its own end.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#13:18">Page 13</a>   It is a great thing to have the consciousness that we are bound up with Him there in heavenly glory, and to know that we can follow Him into the sphere of resurrection and participate in all that constitutes His life in that blessed circle of <b>love</b> and glory where He lives unto God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#16:12">Page 16</a>   Nothing can change that sovereign <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#16:13">Page 16</a>   We may have to learn what poor things we are -- breaking down at every point -- but the <b>love</b> of God knows no change.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#16:14">Page 16</a>   That <b>love</b> is not only the source but the security of our blessing.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#17:1">Page 17</a>   The <b>love</b> of God as the source of all blessing; Christ the security of that blessing, and of those on whom it is bestowed in infinite mercy; and saints in the attitude that becomes them -- seated at the feet of Christ, like Mary ( Luke 10:39 ), to hear and receive those holy words in which He declares the Father's name.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#18:29">Page 18</a>   When a wife comes under the power of her husband's <b>love</b> her interests are merged in his, and then there is communion.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#19:4">Page 19</a>   It is a blessed thing to abide in the consciousness of the <b>love</b> of Christ, then we are protected from evil, and from the snares and wiles of Satan.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#21:14">Page 21</a>   And the inheritance in the New Testament covers all that is in the purpose of God's <b>love</b> to bestow on His sons and children, who are said to be His heirs.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#24:7">Page 24</a>   If we <b>love</b> our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption we shall be prepared to go all the way, but we may expect to be tested.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#31:10">Page 31</a>   There can be no further movement beyond this; it brings us to the permanent resting-place of divine <b>love</b>; we touch what is eternal.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#33:4">Page 33</a>   He purposed in Christ before the world's foundation that a vast company should be holy and without blame before Him in <b>love</b>, marked out for sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, to the praise of the glory of His grace, wherein He has taken us into favour in the Beloved.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#33:13">Page 33</a>  Then God has not only given us a most holy place before Him, and a relationship in <b>love</b> which answers to His pleasure in a supreme way, but as in that place of sonship and favour He has made known to us the mystery of His will.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#35:13">Page 35</a>   The moment is reached typically when priesthood ceases to function and the glory intimates that God is there in the supreme satisfaction of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#36:1">Page 36</a>   God's will is <b>love</b>, and He is determined to have His own way and to have a universe dominated by the will of God; and all that is going to fill that universe is a living reality to the saints at this moment.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#37:7">Page 37</a>   Coming into manhood He brought in the will of God, not in demand, but by securing the satisfaction of His will in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#37:16">Page 37</a>   "That we should be holy and blameless before him in <b>love</b>; having marked us out beforehand for adoption (sonship) through Jesus Christ to himself".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#37:19">Page 37</a>   The ten commandments are the necessary claim of <b>love</b>, and now the truth is clear we find it is in the will of God to satisfy His own <b>love</b>, and what He purposed before the world was to have a vast company before Him holy and without blame, in <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#38:2">Page 38</a>   "The <b>love</b> of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord" -- that gives us the ark.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#38:10">Page 38</a>   "Holy and without blame before him in <b>love</b>" (it is not what they ought to be, but what God's will is that they should be), "marked out beforehand" for sonship, "accepted in the Beloved"; all that is the will of God and has actually come into effect.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#38:15">Page 38</a>   That is, we get an inner circle first upon which the will of God has put a most blessed impress; "holy and without blame before him in <b>love</b>", and "marked out beforehand" for sonship.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#42:19">Page 42</a>   It is possible for us, through infinite grace, to move in the life of Jesus in our responsible life; that is, in dependence, obedience, separation from the world and its idolatry, delighting in the saints, having joy in God and in the inheritance which His <b>love</b> has conferred upon us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#44:5">Page 44</a>   He has received all the gifts that were in the purpose of the Father's <b>love</b> to bestow on men.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#44:24">Page 44</a>   To disregard Christ's gifts is to disregard Christ, for they are His gifts of <b>love</b> to us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#47:12">Page 47</a>   It is a peculiarly blessed experience in which no subtle element of self remains to intrude upon the delight which <b>love</b> finds in an Object, or objects, which give it supreme satisfaction.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#50:20">Page 50</a>  Then myrrh, aloes and cassia suggest that He is clothed in the affections of His companions with the abiding fragrance of His sufferings in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#51:6">Page 51</a>   He came to her once in lowly grace to woo and win her, if it had been possible, but she refused the approaches of His <b>love</b> then.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#54:14">Page 54</a>   The gift of the Spirit, as announced in the glad tidings, becomes the subject of faith; that is, we come to it in the faith of our hearts that it is in the mind and <b>love</b> of God to give us His Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#57:12">Page 57</a>   Hence the apostle prayed that we might be "strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man; that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts, being rooted and founded in <b>love</b>, in order that ye may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#58:1">Page 58</a>   These Scriptures are in my mind as standing in connection with what we have been reminded of lately -- the importance of <b>love</b> to our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#58:5">Page 58</a>   And if we were sure it was exactly like what He was outwardly, it would not supply any ground of <b>love</b> to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#58:6">Page 58</a>   There is no genuine <b>love</b> to the Lord Jesus except as we apprehend what He is inwardly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#58:12">Page 58</a>   He brought those things here in His heart, so that men might know them, and He lived in them; and, if we do not <b>love</b> Him in that character, we can hardly be said to <b>love</b> Him at all.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#58:13">Page 58</a>   That is, to <b>love</b> the Lord as He is, we need to see Him in relation to His Father.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#58:17">Page 58</a>   I shall never <b>love</b> Him until I know that.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#58:18">Page 58</a>   Gratitude in the heart of a believer for what He has done for him often does not go far; it very often stops short of <b>love</b> to Himself -- to His own Person, and has very little separating effect from the world.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#58:19">Page 58</a>   But if we <b>love</b> Him in relation to the Father, we cannot avoid being separated from the world which knows nothing of the Father, who is altogether in separation from the world<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#59:1">Page 59</a>   Indeed, John says, "If any man <b>love</b> the world, the <b>love</b> of the Father is not in him .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#59:10">Page 59</a>   Jesus as a boy of twelve was absorbed in His Father's things, and in that character He becomes an object of <b>love</b> to His own; He is carrying in His heart the secret of all the grace of God for men.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#59:11">Page 59</a>   If we <b>love</b> Him in that character it shows we have apprehended the Father's things.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#59:21">Page 59</a>   We have to <b>love</b> Him in that character as the righteous One, and so we must take on the same character.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#59:22">Page 59</a>   I cannot <b>love</b> something in Him and go on with just the opposite.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#59:25">Page 59</a>   Many believers are hung up for many years because they are not in the path of righteousness; they think they <b>love</b> the Lord, but they do not.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#59:27">Page 59</a>   So that <b>love</b> for the Lord Jesus is a very practical thing; it adjusts us at every turn.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#60:5">Page 60</a>   We <b>love</b> Him if we apprehend Him in that character.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#60:6">Page 60</a>   Then we must take on that character -- <b>love</b> will surely go His way -- and it will make its practical impression on us.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#60:18">Page 60</a>   No one could <b>love</b> the Lord Jesus Christ and not be a worshipper.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#60:21">Page 60</a>   So that genuine <b>love</b> for the Lord Jesus Christ would transform us and fashion us in moral correspondence with Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#60:26">Page 60</a>  These words are the setting forth of all that He is inwardly, and as we see and appreciate Him in this way, we take on the character of the One we <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#61:15">Page 61</a>   Such have been brought up in an atmosphere of <b>love</b>, and shielded from much of the evil that is in the world, but their parents long to see in them the evidence of life.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#65:2">Page 65</a>   There needs to be more concern with us that our thinking shall be on the line of faith and <b>love</b>, and in the current of the Holy Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#65:18">Page 65</a>  Spiritual speaking will always be prompted by <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#65:19">Page 65</a>   Without <b>love</b> there might be all the eloquence of men, and even angels, but the one who utters it will only become "sounding brass or a clanging cymbal".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#65:20">Page 65</a>   Even scriptural truth may be picked up in a mental way, and not held and spoken of in the power of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#66:5">Page 66</a>   If there is not the present vital power of <b>love</b> in intelligent exercise there will be no evidence of life.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#66:13">Page 66</a>   I believe that vigorous spiritual life will express itself in the way of speaking, and such speaking as will be a comfort to those who <b>love</b> God amid the feeble conditions of the last days.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#71:2">Page 71</a>   It prepares the way for another order of things connected with sonship, where there is a learning of all the positive thoughts of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#72:2">Page 72</a>  It is a title accorded to Him by many, but He is only such in reality to those who <b>love</b> Him, like the two disciples ( John 1:38 ), or Martha ( John 11:28 ), or His own ( John 13:13 ), or Mary Magdalene ( John 20:16 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#73:16">Page 73</a>   There is nothing cramped or narrow in our thoughts, and <b>love</b> moves in freedom.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#74:2">Page 74</a>   It is perhaps as touching an expression of His personal <b>love</b> to those who followed Him here as anything that is recorded.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#75:4">Page 75</a>   It was reserved to the Lord to give "a cup" its place in relation to the passover, suggesting a solace and joy which the <b>love</b> of God as revealed in His death in passover aspect would be to His disciples as left in the scene of tribulation.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#75:5">Page 75</a>  In the kingdom of God <b>love</b> must be supreme, for He is <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#75:6">Page 75</a>   <b>Love</b> was the motive behind the Passover, for "God commends his <b>love</b> to us, in that, we being still sinners, Christ has died for us".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#75:7">Page 75</a>   We are privileged to share mutually in that <b>love</b> while we remain in the place of tribulation.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#75:10">Page 75</a>   We boast in hope of the glory of God, and we boast in tribulations, having the <b>love</b> of God shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit given to us ( Romans 5 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#75:11">Page 75</a>   The Lord was going out of the scene of tribulation; the peculiar solace of the <b>love</b> of God as known through death in such a scene was to be theirs.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#75:13">Page 75</a>  There was a revelation of divine <b>love</b> in the passover which was to be their common portion in the place from which He would be absent.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#75:16">Page 75</a>   It suggests a mutual sharing in the joy of the <b>love</b> which was revealed in the true Passover.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#75:17">Page 75</a>   What sustaining and preserving power would this <b>love</b> have as known in each heart!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#75:20">Page 75</a>   He would be known and remembered in the <b>love</b> in which He gave His body, and in which the cup was the new covenant in His blood poured out for His own.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#75:21">Page 75</a>   This is to sustain us in relation to Him, so that instead of His absence leading to His fading from the affections of His own He is more and more known and cherished there, and His saints are kept in heart-contact with each other in relation to Him and His wondrous <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#76:3">Page 76</a>  It is the bringing in of God as known in <b>love</b> in the establishment of relations between Himself and us which are most blessed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#76:4">Page 76</a>   It is not only that we have the support and solace of the <b>love</b> of God in presence of the contrarieties of the scene around, but we know God through the death of Christ in the precious thoughts of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#76:9">Page 76</a>   We know the <b>love</b> of a blessed Man who has devoted His body for us so that the will of God may be established in our fullest blessing, and in that same Person the <b>love</b> of God has been made known as setting us in relation to Him according to what He is in His nature.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#76:14">Page 76</a>   We have full joy in the knowledge of God, and in those relations in which His <b>love</b> has set us with Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#76:15">Page 76</a>  Four things have a distinct place in relation to the Lord's supper: (1) an affectionate remembrance of Him in giving thanks and breaking the bread and giving thanks for the cup; (2) the communion we have together in so doing; (3) the announcement of the death of the Lord until He come -- the public testimony on God's part to the fact that the Lord has died there; (4) the occasion which it affords to the <b>love</b> of Christ to manifest Himself to those who <b>love</b> Him ( John 14:18 ) CHRIST LIFTED UP AND BURIED John 3:14  - 16;  John 8:28 ;  John 12:32 , 33;  John 19:38  - 42;  Colossians 2:12 ;  Deuteronomy 21:22 , 23 There is great spiritual gain in the consideration of our Lord Jesus Christ in every aspect in which Scripture presents Him to the view of faith; and the above scriptures call our attention to Him as being lifted up and being buried<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#77:7">Page 77</a>   One is the great redeeming act of Christ in <b>love</b> to those under curse; He became a curse; the other is the wondrous act of God having in view His purpose that we should become His righteousness in Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#77:8">Page 77</a>   The Son of man as lifted up was publicly seen to be in the place of sin and curse, but it is our peace and joy to know that He was not there on His own account at all, but in divine <b>love</b> on behalf of those who were under sin and death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#77:9">Page 77</a>   His lifting up, as referred to in  John 3:14 , was on God's part as given in <b>love</b>, that eternal life might be brought in and become the portion of those who were under sin and death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#78:1">Page 78</a>   But this testimony comes to men in the way of grace, for the One who has been lifted up in the place of sin was there as the great manifestation of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#78:6">Page 78</a>   The lifting up in chapter 3 is on God's part in <b>love</b>, but in chapter 8 it is what men do: "When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#79:8">Page 79</a>   This is the blessed way which divine <b>love</b> has taken to draw men away from a world fully exposed as having nothing in common with God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#80:12">Page 80</a>   The condition in which Christ was made sin went out of God's sight in His burial, and this is of immense importance when we consider all its consequences in their bearing on those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#81:5">Page 81</a>   He descended in the strength of His <b>love</b> to the lower parts of the earth; we get the full measure of His descent as we take in the thought of His burial.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#81:8">Page 81</a>   In anointing His body for burial she showed that the full depth of His descent in <b>love</b> was before her heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#82:15">Page 82</a>   The mighty power of God acted in those "lower parts of the earth" into which Christ had descended in <b>love</b>, so that His burial really took Him to the point which would witness to the fullest expression of the might of God's strength.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#83:5">Page 83</a>   <b>Love</b> descended to that point, but the might of God's strength came in to raise Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#83:6">Page 83</a>   The <b>love</b> in which He descended was towards us, and the power that raised Him is towards us also.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#83:7">Page 83</a>   The whole matter had in view God's wondrous purposes of <b>love</b> in regard to us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#83:14">Page 83</a>  A further result of the burial of Christ is its bearing on those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#84:11">Page 84</a>   His <b>love</b> demanded the privilege of identification with Christ in connection with His burial.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#84:15">Page 84</a>   His going down to burial was a movement of <b>love</b> on his part, and it is a movement which we all have to make if we are to know the true meaning of being "buried with him in baptism".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#85:6">Page 85</a>   The Lord went finally out of this world by burial, and His grave is left "hewn in the rock" as a permanent spot for <b>love</b> to occupy, in a spiritual sense, as soon as there is a readiness to do so.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#88:8">Page 88</a>   But notwithstanding this, we cannot help seeing how little they entered into what was present with them in the Son of God, or into the communications of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#89:19">Page 89</a>   No one but the Comforter could make the Son of God a present reality to our hearts, or give us the joy of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#89:29">Page 89</a>   The whole of this blessed and divine system of <b>love</b> is pervaded by the Spirit and it is He who gives the intelligence of it for our souls' deep joy<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#90:3">Page 90</a>  THE FATHER'S <b>LOVE</b> "On this account the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it again",  John 10:17 <br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#91:3">Page 91</a>   The Father loved the Son before the world's foundation, but we cannot enter into that <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#91:4">Page 91</a>   The character of the <b>love</b>, as well as its degree, is altogether beyond us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#91:5">Page 91</a>  But here the Lord speaks of the Father's <b>love</b> to Him in a way which we can, in measure, enter into.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#91:6">Page 91</a>   If the Father loves Him because He laid down His life that He might take it again, I think we may say with all reverence that we <b>love</b> Him for the same reason.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#91:11">Page 91</a>  He laid down His life that we might know the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#91:12">Page 91</a>   We perceive divine <b>love</b> in His death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#91:16">Page 91</a>   The Father's <b>love</b> and glory have come out in the most blessed way, and thus He has been glorified by the Son.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#91:17">Page 91</a>   He has laid down His life that all this light of <b>love</b> and glory might shine forth for our hearts, and the Father loves Him because of it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#91:18">Page 91</a>   Can we not say that we <b>love</b> Him too?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#92:2">Page 92</a>   In that character He is the Object of the Father's <b>love</b>, and surely of ours also.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#92:5">Page 92</a>  Thus we come under the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#92:7">Page 92</a>   In both scriptures a reason is given for the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#92:8">Page 92</a>   God's <b>love</b> is sovereign; it flows out of its own fulness without regard to any reason outside itself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#92:9">Page 92</a>   But these blessed reasons are given for the Father's <b>love</b> towards Christ and the saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#93:10">Page 93</a>   It is the joy of His <b>love</b> to have our companionship in that place.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#94:15">Page 94</a>   His purposes of <b>love</b> were not seen in the works, but in giving men a part and place with the Son in the Father's house.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#95:8">Page 95</a>   "As the Father has loved me, I also have loved you: abide in my <b>love</b>",  John 15:9 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#95:9">Page 95</a>   This is clearly a complacent <b>love</b>, for it is as the Father has loved Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#95:11">Page 95</a>   "If ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my <b>love</b>, as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his <b>love</b>", verse 10.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#95:12">Page 95</a>   He has a peculiar joy in His saints as those who keep His commandments: obedient lovers are the only ones who afford Him this joy, or who really abide in His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#96:2">Page 96</a>   It is now as glorified that He gives effect to every thought of divine <b>love</b>, and thus glorifies the Father.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#96:14">Page 96</a>   Eternal life and sonship for men are two great thoughts of divine <b>love</b>, and it is the joy of the Son to secure them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#97:12">Page 97</a>  The "men" saw in Jesus One who was in relationship with God as His Father, and they had a sense that the Father's <b>love</b> rested upon Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#97:13">Page 97</a>   The last verse of the chapter shows that the making known of the Father's name brings the <b>love</b> with which He loved the Son into those to whom it is made known, and they are to have such a glory that the world will know that the Father has loved them as He loved Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#98:4">Page 98</a>   That is to say, that His joy is brought to completion in His own as they take in the great thoughts of divine <b>love</b> THE DESIRES OF THE SON OF GOD FOR HIS OWN John 17:11 , 15, 21, 24 These verses bring before us what was in the heart of the Son of God as He went into death<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#99:12">Page 99</a>   The depths of infinite divine grace and <b>love</b> and holiness-for it is "Holy Father"-are in that name, and all was given to the Son that He might make it known.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#99:19">Page 99</a>   The goodness, grace, <b>love</b>, and glory of that name are all told out, and the One who made it known is the One who can instruct our hearts in it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#100:2">Page 100</a>   The Son would have us enclosed in all the blessedness of the Father's name, kept in the grace of that name, kept in the <b>love</b> of which it speaks!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#101:5">Page 101</a>   It has been given to Him to bring to pass every purpose of <b>love</b> and blessing that was in the Father's heart from eternity.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#101:12">Page 101</a>   This place the Father's eternal <b>love</b> has given Him; it will be His distinctive glory for ever.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#109:8">Page 109</a>   But we have always found, and shall find, that the One who searches is the One who supports, and He teaches us that we can only follow righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace, as calling upon Him out of a pure heart; that is, He alone is our resource and strength.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#109:15">Page 109</a>   What is important is that His thought shall be secured in spiritual reality <b>LOVE</b> AND IDOLATRY Acts 20:22 , 23;  Joshua 23 The time was drawing near for Paul to depart--the spiritual vessel of uncorrupted truth was about to go, and what concerned the name and interests of Christ and of God was to be transferred to the hands of the elders of Ephesus, representing the responsible element in the assembly<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#110:16">Page 110</a>   God is not proposing an impossibility: He is proposing what is a necessity to His own <b>love</b> and He has given His Holy Spirit to form in our hearts affections which have their spring and object in Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#111:3">Page 111</a>  We are apt to overlook the importance of watching against any influence which dulls the sense in our souls of the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#111:5">Page 111</a>   He says to them, "Take great heed unto your souls, that ye <b>love</b> Jehovah your God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#111:10">Page 111</a>   The two sets of influences are always there; the influence of the <b>love</b> of God and the influences represented by the nations of Canaan, the effect of which is to counteract divine influence.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#111:11">Page 111</a>   What answers to "the residue of these nations" is the influence of persons who are not governed by <b>love</b> to God and by what is spiritual; therefore it is of the greatest importance that we should preserve purity in our associations.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#111:14">Page 111</a>   We are apt to forget that influences which rob us of the enjoyment of God's <b>love</b> often operate through nice, attractive people, not through drunkards, thieves, or immoral persons.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#112:3">Page 112</a>   Are we loving God and enjoying what His <b>love</b> gives?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#112:7">Page 112</a>   It is a witness to us that whatever God may have done for us-however great the extent of His <b>love</b> and power-there are still remaining elements which have to be refused.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#112:9">Page 112</a>   There are always in the human heart elements which tend to rob us of the enjoyment of God and then we cannot <b>love</b> Him or serve Him.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#115:6">Page 115</a>   The glad tidings are concerning Him; all that we get in this epistle to the Romans-salvation, redemption, divine righteousness, justification, peace, reconciliation, joy in God, the knowledge of the <b>love</b> of God, sonship, glory-- all bring out the greatness of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#117:1">Page 117</a>   Before He created Adam as an innocent man He had planned to have men before Him in <b>love</b>, holy and blameless, and also marked out for sonship.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#117:22">Page 117</a>   Being "rooted and founded in <b>love</b>" is that the very nature of God becomes the source from which the saints draw support, and "the breadth and length and depth and height" are of that immensity which the <b>love</b> of God will fill eternally<br>

<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#158:18">Page 158</a>   He cherished the wisdom that would be His resource: wisdom was the nursling of His <b>love</b>, His delight.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#158:19">Page 158</a>   It was His delight because His own wisdom was going to secure the perfect satisfaction of His own <b>love</b>.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#161:5">Page 161</a>   The believer recognises Him, and we are free to sit down together tonight and think how He has exercised lordship in order that the <b>love</b> of God might be satisfied, and that by Him we should be placed in the presence of God for His satisfaction.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#161:9">Page 161</a>   Everything that the blessed God was looking for for the eternal satisfaction of His <b>love</b>, He has committed to the one Lord.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#161:14">Page 161</a>   He could in the prophetic word speak of joying over them, resting in His <b>love</b>, exulting over them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#162:2">Page 162</a>   In Joseph we see a marvellous type of the Lord as Administrator to meet the need of man, but the thought of ministering to the perfect satisfaction of the <b>love</b> of God is not there: that is what we have in lordship.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#162:3">Page 162</a>   Solomon in all his glory sets forth the glory of Christ as the Son of the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#162:8">Page 162</a>   That scripture involves the perfect satisfaction of all that the <b>love</b> of God proposed for itself in eternity: it will have its culmination in eternity.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#162:15">Page 162</a>   It is the glory of a divine Person in manhood who is great enough, and blessed enough, and has resource enough in every way to give effect to the whole delight and satisfaction of the <b>love</b> of God in the blessing of men.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#162:17">Page 162</a>   When we are in the Father's house in company with the Son we shall share the <b>love</b> that flows out of the Father's heart on Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#162:18">Page 162</a>   And when we know the Father in the intimacy of the home circle, in the blessedness of His <b>love</b>, what a delight it will be to turn to the beloved Son and adore Him in the greatness of that glory which attached to Him in manhood, the One great enough to give effect to all the eternal thoughts of the Father's <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#163:2">Page 163</a>   Now do you not <b>love</b> Him?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#163:17">Page 163</a>   It is not what we know about one God and one Lord, but how we <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#163:18">Page 163</a>   We cannot measure one another on that line, but the blessed God and one Lord measures us on the line of how much we <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#163:23">Page 163</a>  THE LORD'S SUPPER The <b>love</b> of Christ is the central thought in the Lord's supper<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#164:3">Page 164</a>  As the Lord's day dawns we realise in a peculiar way that the Lord is absent, and we who <b>love</b> Him long for His company, and come together to break bread for the calling of Him to mind.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#164:5">Page 164</a>   It was the suggestion of His own <b>love</b>, and it can only be rightly done under the impulse of that <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#164:10">Page 164</a>  When the Lord made known to Paul what had taken place on the night when He was delivered up with a view to the Supper being eaten by gentile believers, He intimated from heaven that His <b>love</b> to the saints was as great as when He died.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#164:13">Page 164</a>   Indeed, we never knew the Lord as the apostles knew Him, but we have the Supper suggesting His great <b>love</b> in all its abidingness for us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#164:14">Page 164</a>  We can individually cherish the Lord's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#164:15">Page 164</a>   A bed-ridden saint may have all the preciousness of such a word as "If any one <b>love</b> me, he will keep my word, and my Father will <b>love</b> him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him",  John 14:23 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#164:16">Page 164</a>   But there is a great difference between this and the enjoyment of the Lord's <b>love</b> collectively and in assembly affections.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#164:18">Page 164</a>  In  Luke 22  the conditions on the side of the disciples were very imperfect, but there was ability in His <b>love</b> to displace all that was imperfect by the perfection that was in Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#164:19">Page 164</a>  There was ability in His <b>love</b> to adjust everything<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#165:2">Page 165</a>   The Lord delights to assert the supremacy of His <b>love</b>; He delights to bring the saints effectively into the good of all that was secured for them by His death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#165:3">Page 165</a>  The <b>love</b> set forth in the Supper intimates to the saints the delight which the Lord would have in coming to His loved company.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#165:5">Page 165</a>   It requires suited conditions for Him to be there, and if they are present He would not keep away; in His <b>love</b> He must come.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#165:9">Page 165</a>   The power for testimony would be commensurate with the high elevation to which sovereign <b>love</b> has brought us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#165:16">Page 165</a>   But if we know it as the suggestion of His <b>love</b>, and see how He values our affections and interest, we shall delight to come together with the brethren to pray.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#167:11">Page 167</a>   But then this involved correspondence with Jesus, in whom the service of divine <b>love</b> to men was perfect.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#167:12">Page 167</a>   It had meant "putting to death" for Him, and it meant for Paul a daily dying ( 1 Corinthians 15:31 ), a working of death in him, and a consuming of the outward man in the service of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#167:15">Page 167</a>   The life of Jesus was a life spent in the service of <b>love</b>, with no issue here but "putting to death".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#168:2">Page 168</a>   The service of <b>love</b> would have its recompense in resurrection and in the company there of those reached and blessed through the service.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#168:3">Page 168</a>  In the life of Jesus divine <b>love</b> was in activity, and, in speaking of the life of Jesus being manifested in his body, I think Paul was referring to the service of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#168:4">Page 168</a>   Some moral qualities may be, so to speak, self-contained, but <b>love</b> cannot be self-contained; it must be active towards others.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#168:5">Page 168</a>   Paul held him-self- held his body-for the activities of the service of <b>love</b>, and he was prepared to move on that line at personal cost.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#168:6">Page 168</a>   The service of <b>love</b> is always costly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#168:7">Page 168</a>   It is affecting to see at what a cost God has reached the end which His <b>love</b> desired.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#168:8">Page 168</a>   The Lord Jesus in the activity of His <b>love</b> has effected the pleasure of God, but at the cost of death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#168:10">Page 168</a>  God is righteous and holy, but His motive nature is <b>love</b>; He has given expression to it at great cost; and it can only come out in His servants at the cost of suffering.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#168:11">Page 168</a>   It is a wonderful thing to appreciate "the life of Jesus", and for our bodies to become vessels for the manifestation of a life devoted to the service of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#168:15">Page 168</a>   Everything was due to Jesus, but He did not consider that; His whole life was marked by dedication to the service of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#168:22">Page 168</a>  It is possible to be occupied with the attainment of certain spiritual conditions in ourselves, but our great desire should be to be liberated for the service of <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#169:1">Page 169</a>   As practically free for the service of <b>love</b> among the brethren, the life of Jesus would come into manifestation.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#169:2">Page 169</a>   It is a blessed moment in the history of the believer when he definitely presents his body to God, and the result of this comes out practically in the service of <b>love</b> amongst the saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#169:5">Page 169</a>   Our place in the assembly is determined by the measure in which we serve in <b>love</b>, and we are measured by this golden reed in the place where we are best known.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#171:14">Page 171</a>   Redemption clears the way for all the activities of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#171:15">Page 171</a>   So even our offences minister unto <b>love</b>: my sins have rendered me a great service!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#171:17">Page 171</a>   You respond in <b>love</b> to the <b>love</b> that forgave them all.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#171:22">Page 171</a>   That I have committed many sins becomes, through grace known in forgiveness, a spring of <b>love</b> to God in my heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#171:27">Page 171</a>   Those who do, increase in the knowledge of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#172:13">Page 172</a>  In chapter 1 we see that God has marked us out for sonship "to the praise of the glory of his grace"; and we have obtained an inheritance in Christ that "we should be to the praise of his glory"; and in chapter 2 we see how God has taken up such as we for the satisfaction of His own <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#172:15">Page 172</a>   But on God's side it is "for his great <b>love</b> wherewith he loved us".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#172:16">Page 172</a>   God has taken us up, not only in the depth of mercy, but to satisfy His own <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#173:1">Page 173</a>   The object in view in all this is that we may be brought consciously into the presence of the holy <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#173:2">Page 173</a>  In Old Testament times men were not in the presence of the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#173:5">Page 173</a>   The Object which alone could furnish satisfaction to the <b>love</b> of God was not yet revealed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#173:10">Page 173</a>   The Father's <b>love</b> found its perfect repose in that blessed One, and He found His repose in the <b>love</b> of which He was the Object-He was "in the bosom of the Father".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#173:11">Page 173</a>  But the beloved Son was alone in the presence of the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#173:15">Page 173</a>   Sinful flesh could not be brought into the presence of God's <b>love</b>, but it has been condemned in the death of Christ.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#173:22">Page 173</a>  The great thing for us is to see that God would bring us to live together with Him in the presence of that wondrous <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#173:23">Page 173</a>   To be quickened together with Christ is to be made to live in spirit outside everything that has been touched by sin or that has come under death in the presence of God's holy <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#174:6">Page 174</a>   It was <b>love</b> that qualified Mary to receive this message and to carry it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#174:8">Page 174</a>   The most important qualification of a gift is the jealousy of <b>love</b> that the message should not be marred in any way.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#176:10">Page 176</a>   A man bowing his knees to the Father, and strengthened by the Father's Spirit so that Christ dwells in his heart through faith, will surely be "rooted and grounded in <b>love</b>".<br>

<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#176:19">Page 176</a>   This is a far wider thought than His <b>love</b> to us, blessed as that is.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#176:20">Page 176</a>   It is the deep, devoted <b>love</b> in which He has taken up all the Father's counsels and will give full effect to them for the Father's glory<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#177:2">Page 177</a>   The Father would have us to see the wonderful place that Christ holds in relation to a "vast universe of bliss", and how He will pervade it all with His own <b>love</b>, so that it may be filled with what answers perfectly to the Father.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#177:3">Page 177</a>   The <b>love</b> of Christ will extend to the utmost bounds of the universe of bliss.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#177:14">Page 177</a>   And the assembly is the vessel in which the fulness of God will shine forth, filling all things with light and <b>love</b> and blessedness.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#179:5">Page 179</a>   Nothing could give such assurance of God's <b>love</b> as this; nothing could make blessing more certain, nothing could so effectually remove every doubt and misgiving from an exercised heart as this great and divine fact.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#179:10">Page 179</a>  God has had from eternity a resource equal to all His blessed thoughts of <b>love</b> and grace.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#180:14">Page 180</a>   The <b>love</b> of God known in his heart preserves him from loving the world.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#187:3">Page 187</a>   Many thousands of angels would have been at His side in a moment, if He or the Father had spoken the word, to sweep aside every adversary, but they had to be spectators of a self-sacrificing <b>love</b> that would not spare itself-that would save others but not Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#189:7">Page 189</a>   In the third it is a question of the energy of the Spirit; and then in the fourth the thought is that we are for Christ as the result of the service of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#191:28">Page 191</a>  We have to go back, each one of us, through exercise of heart and conscience, to the first <b>love</b> of the assembly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#191:29">Page 191</a>   It could hardly be said of us that we have lost our first <b>love</b>, because we never properly had it<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#192:1">Page 192</a>   I question whether many of us have known much about first <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#192:5">Page 192</a>   The apostle knew for himself the <b>love</b> of Christ; he says: "the <b>love</b> of Christ constraineth us".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#192:6">Page 192</a>   The Spirit of God wants a response to the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#192:8">Page 192</a>   We see an illustration of it in  Jeremiah 2:2 : "I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the <b>love</b> of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land not sown".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#192:11">Page 192</a>   They were in full response to God; it was the moment of their first <b>love</b>, it was a moment when He was supreme in their hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#193:3">Page 193</a>  Now I close with a few words on  Ephesians 5:25  - 27, where we find the thought of the service of Christ's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#193:6">Page 193</a>   It is all viewed here as the service of Christ's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#193:9">Page 193</a>   Christ has a title to the assembly, and on that ground He serves her in <b>love</b> to fit her for presentation to Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#193:11">Page 193</a>   No, He is set on removing everything that is contrary to the thoughts of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#193:14">Page 193</a>   You know that the Lord has called attention to something in your ways that does not please Him, and when the Lord pointed it out you either took the side of Christ's <b>love</b> with regard to it and judged it and set it aside, or you have shut out Christ's <b>love</b> for the sake of that wretched thing.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#193:21">Page 193</a>   May we be for Christ in our practical ways, in our affections, in the energy of the Spirit, and as being sanctified and cleansed by the service of His <b>love</b>, so as to be morally suited for presentation to Himself!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#193:23">Page 193</a>  THE WASHING OF REGENERATION Titus 3:4  - 7 The washing of regeneration involves the recognition that everything was wrong in which we lived before, but the kind-ness and <b>love</b> to man of a Saviour God has made it possible for us to come on to new ground in this world<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#194:4">Page 194</a>   This is really a matter of the kindness and <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#194:18">Page 194</a>   We are on the divine side here, and it is good to be there, for there we see things according to the kindness and <b>love</b> to man of a Saviour God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#194:22">Page 194</a>   The gospel side of things is always the greatest side, for all on that side is according to a divine measure-the Spirit, the children's place, sonship, the inheritance, all given because of the <b>love</b> of God, and because nothing less would suit His mind<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#195:7">Page 195</a>   We have such meagre thoughts of what Christianity is because we take our thoughts so much from what we see around us, and from what we experience, rather than from the kindness and <b>love</b> to man of a Saviour God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#195:9">Page 195</a>   A different character of man is introduced here by the kindness and <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#195:14">Page 195</a>   He will move on the line of kindness and <b>love</b> to man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#196:2">Page 196</a>   It is the result of having come under the sway of grace, and of having found liberty in the knowledge of God, and of having been brought to realise the purpose of God's sovereign <b>love</b>, and the sovereignty of His compassions.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#197:9">Page 197</a>   The reason I dwell on this is that I think the renewal of the Spirit does not operate in the old condition at all but in a new condition, in that new place into which the kindness and <b>love</b> of God has brought us, and in which we find the salvation which the <b>love</b> to man of our Saviour God has provided.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#198:11">Page 198</a>   Titus looks at it on the divine side, the way the kindness and <b>love</b> to man of our Saviour God has appeared-that is the way God saves man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#200:5">Page 200</a>   Man after the flesh always moves under the influence of evil, but man under the power of the renewing of the Holy Spirit moves under the influence of God, on the line of kindness and <b>love</b> to man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#202:9">Page 202</a>   It is a dedicated vessel, dedicated to the service of <b>love</b>, and it perishes in the service of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#202:14">Page 202</a>   Not in mind or in spirit, but always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus, Paul always had in his body the evidence that he was engaged in the service of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#202:16">Page 202</a>   We see the same <b>love</b> coming out in the life of Jesus and it was fully expressed in His dying -- that was the supreme expression of the service of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#202:18">Page 202</a>   It is not a man getting old and his body wearing out in a natural way, but his outward man perishes in the service of <b>love</b>: the body is held as a dedicated vessel for the service of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#202:19">Page 202</a>   It is a most blessed compensation for the wear and tear of the service of <b>love</b> that the inward man is to be renewed day by day.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#202:22">Page 202</a>   It occurred to me that if we were more dedicated, and really presented our bodies a living sacrifice to God, holding our bodies for the service of <b>love</b>, and prepared to suffer in the service of <b>love</b>, that we should get the compensation-the inward man in touch with eternity and new creation, and all the blessedness that follows in this chapter; we should be renewed day by day<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#204:20">Page 204</a>   By the Son of the Father's <b>love</b> "were created all things, the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones, or lordships, or principalities, or authorities: all things have been created by him, and for him",  Colossians 1:16 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#206:1">Page 206</a>   Other scriptures bring the work of the cross before us as accomplished in weakness and humiliation, done, too, in matchless divine <b>love</b>; but here, in keeping with the context, it is the infinite greatness of that work which is brought before us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#206:5">Page 206</a>   He has glorified God-that is, He has brought the glory of God into full and everlasting display while making purification of sins, so that God can take up those who were sinners, and can bring them into infinite blessing, yea, into the knowledge of Himself in grace and <b>love</b>, according to His own counsels.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#209:11">Page 209</a>   Well may we wonder and adore as we contemplate "the Christ, who is over all, God blessed for ever", thus stooping in the humiliation of matchless grace to bring the testimony of divine <b>love</b> into the very place of sin and death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#210:18">Page 210</a>   If the SON speaks, it must be to make known the Father's name and nature-to declare the Father's grace and <b>love</b> as unfolded in His own counsels of blessing-and all this revealed according to the measure of the SON, if indeed we may be permitted to speak of measure where all is infinite.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#211:16">Page 211</a>   He would have us to apprehend that we are called to the blessing of sonship-to know that we are loved as the Son is loved, according to those wonderful words, "that the <b>love</b> wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#212:2">Page 212</a>   Of what vast importance is it, then, that we should have Him before our hearts in all His greatness, so that our hearts may have a true measure of the greatness and blessedness of the revelation of God on the one hand, and, on the other, that we may know the character of the blessing to which we are called, so as to enter into it and respond to the <b>love</b> that has called us into it, that thus we may be to the Father's pleasure and to the glory and satisfaction of the Son THE HUMILIATION, EXALTATION, AND SUPREMACY OF CHRIST Hebrews 2 We have already seen that in the first chapter of this epistle the Son of God is set before us in the greatness of His Person, and in all the excellence of His inherited Name as come into manhood<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#215:5">Page 215</a>   Now the Son in all the competency of His blessed Person has undertaken to bring divine grace and <b>love</b> into the very place of the creature's ruin; He has come into the place of sin and death to glorify God there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#215:12">Page 215</a>   But in connection with this the infinite perfection of Christ has been brought into display, and all the goodness, grace, and <b>love</b> of God revealed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#217:11">Page 217</a>   He has undertaken in <b>love</b> to set them apart according to the holiness of God from everything which would not suit that holiness, and to accomplish this He has gone into death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#218:15">Page 218</a>   <b>Love</b> will bring us near to the Lord, and then in intimacy with Him we shall learn what His saints are to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#218:18">Page 218</a>   He could say, "I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known; that the <b>love</b> with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them", John 17: 26.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#219:3">Page 219</a>   The music of God's praise is found in the assembly, so that in the midst of a groaning creation and of a world where all is discord, and where everything seems to compromise the righteousness, goodness, and <b>love</b> of God, there is found a circle whence melodious praise ascends to Him-the praise of all that He has wrought and the praise of all that He is in His attributes and nature.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#219:7">Page 219</a>   We are of the sanctified company, and as such are entirely divested of everything unsuited to divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#219:8">Page 219</a>   We are privileged to know our place thus in the sanctuary, and by the Spirit and by the priestly grace of Christ to be abstracted from the world and the flesh, and all things which are connected with our responsible life on earth, so that we may be with Christ as His brethren before the Father's face, holy and without blame in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#219:9">Page 219</a>   Thus entering the holiest we reach a circle where divine <b>love</b> is in perfect rest, and where nothing is seen or heard but Christ-Christ in His brethren, and His song issuing from their hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#219:12">Page 219</a>   Thus to be in God's holy shrine, and before His face for the pleasure of His <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#224:3">Page 224</a>   Christ intercedes for us in all these things, and they do not separate us from His <b>love</b>, so that we can more than conquer through Him that has loved us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#225:11">Page 225</a>   The blood of Jesus speaks of the ending of man in the flesh; the rending of the veil was typically the ending even of Christ after the flesh; but the new and living way speaks of the revelation of God in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#225:12">Page 225</a>   In the same wondrous moment man was removed and God was revealed, and now there is a way paved with divine <b>love</b> over which our souls may travel into most holy things.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#225:14">Page 225</a>   By the Spirit we may be free from hindrances and disturbing elements, and in the consciousness of the <b>love</b> of God may reach a spot where we realise that everything that is of God and for God is established in Christ glorified.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#227:9">Page 227</a>   A true heart is one that responds to divine Persons and divine <b>love</b>; it is illustrated in the woman who anointed Him in  Matthew 26 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#228:8">Page 228</a>   Hence the <b>love</b> of the brethren marks this assembly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#229:6">Page 229</a>   She has reached the completion of what is possible, so that the complacent <b>love</b> of Christ rests upon her.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#230:8">Page 230</a>   It is the want of <b>love</b> that hinders, not the want of light.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#230:9">Page 230</a>   We need to live more in the <b>love</b> of Christ for the assembly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#230:11">Page 230</a>   To know that <b>love</b> is an assembly exercise which is to be followed up to its full gain.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#231:5">Page 231</a>   It would greatly promote the service of <b>love</b> amongst the saints if we were all more jealous in regard to the crown.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#233:9">Page 233</a>   It answers to  Zephaniah 3:17 : "He will rest in his <b>love</b>: he will exult over thee with singing".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#233:24">Page 233</a>   His <b>love</b> for her is the <b>love</b> of complacency, as I believe it is, too, in Zephaniah.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#233:25">Page 233</a>   He rests in His <b>love</b>, when He has secured in the remnant what answers to Himself in affection.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac17.htm#233:26">Page 233</a>   There is a result of divine working which engages and captivates, if we may say so with reverence, the <b>love</b> of divine Persons<br>
<h3>Volume 18 - The House of God</h3>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#7:2">Page 7</a>   In His dispensational and governmental ways, and in view of all His purposes of <b>love</b> and grace, He has not yet taken possession.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#19:6">Page 19</a>   God would have His saints in the perfect liberty of His holy <b>love</b>; Satan seeks to keep them in the bondage of self-occupation.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#22:13">Page 22</a>   We feed upon Christ as the One who came in deep divine <b>love</b> under holy judgment for us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#22:14">Page 22</a>   He alone could sustain that judgment, and because He has done so the very judgment to which we are exposed has become the evidence to us of the <b>love</b> of Christ, for He has endured and exhausted it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#22:15">Page 22</a>   We can never disconnect the thought of the judgment from the divine Person who bore it in the greatness of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#22:16">Page 22</a>   The judgment of God upon sin is infinite, but Christ has borne it in <b>love</b> that He might become the food of our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#22:17">Page 22</a>   God would have us to be nourished upon the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#22:19">Page 22</a>   We need to be nourished -- to have our spiritual affections sustained and invigorated by the knowledge of Christ in the blessed <b>love</b> in which He came under judgment for us<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#23:1">Page 23</a>   As our hearts are nourished with the personal perfections and <b>love</b> of Christ, holiness becomes a necessity to our souls.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#23:2">Page 23</a>   Everyone who is affected by the <b>love</b> of Christ feels that he must be apart from that for which Christ died.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#23:6">Page 23</a>   We judge ourselves not in misery of soul but in the presence of divine <b>love</b> and in communion with God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#26:15">Page 26</a>  The proper effect of the wonderful grace made known in the gospel is that, as nourished by the perfections and <b>love</b> of Christ, and as divinely instructed by His death, we are prepared to leave Egypt, and to come, in spirit, to apprehend Christ risen and ascended.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#28:15">Page 28</a>   In His sovereign <b>love</b> and mercy He has overshadowed us with His wings.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#29:10">Page 29</a>   "In his <b>love</b> and in his pity he redeemed them: and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old" ( Isaiah 63:9 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#29:17">Page 29</a>   How could we understand it, if we left out the thought of His <b>love</b>?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#29:18">Page 29</a>   "I have loved thee with an everlasting <b>love</b>: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee" ( Jeremiah 31:3 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#29:21">Page 29</a>   God reveals Himself by the gospel in supreme grace and <b>love</b> in order to break down all our self-willed distrust of Him so that we may come under His blessed control.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#36:14">Page 36</a>   "Behold, what manner of <b>love</b> the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons [children] of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not" ( 1 John 3:1 )<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#37:3">Page 37</a>   May we be more willing to occupy the place that really belongs to us, through divine <b>love</b>, as priests and children of God!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#37:4">Page 37</a>  If Christ brings us to the Father's presence you may be sure that He brings us there without stain or reproach, in perfect suitability to the Father's holy <b>love</b>, so that we are before Him as objects of delight to His heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#37:9">Page 37</a>   But it is God's mind that we should know and enjoy our place of association with the Son of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#37:10">Page 37</a>  Christ has a sanctified company of those whom He can present holy and unblamable and irreproachable before God for the satisfaction of God's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#37:12">Page 37</a>   It may be said that very few have apprehended these great thoughts of divine <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#45:4">Page 45</a>   The death of Christ was needed for this; or rather I would say, CHRIST in the place of sin and death for the glory of God, and in absolute devotedness and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#47:4">Page 47</a>   The Apostle Paul had come under the influence of the devotedness of Christ when he said, "The <b>love</b> of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead; and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them and rose again".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#47:5">Page 47</a>   The apostle had come under the influence of the <b>love</b> of Christ -- that <b>love</b> held him in its power.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#47:6">Page 47</a>   The devoted and self-sacrificing <b>love</b> in which Christ had come into death for the glory of God held all the avenues of his soul, was the spring of his service, and the influence that regulated his walk in this world.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#47:8">Page 47</a>   This is the man who prays for us in  Ephesians 3  that we may "know the <b>love</b> of Christ which passeth knowledge".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#47:9">Page 47</a>   God would have us come under the influence of the <b>love</b> in which Christ came into death so that in result the universe might be filled with the knowledge of God -- with His glory and with His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#48:15">Page 48</a>   The priests were presented before Jehovah with their hands full of things which spoke of the perfections, devotedness, and <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#49:7">Page 49</a>   But the feeding upon the ram of consecration answers to saints being nourished upon the <b>love</b> of Christ in order to be strengthened for approach.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#49:10">Page 49</a>  May we know more what it is to feed upon Christ in that wondrous devoted <b>love</b> in which He has taken up everything for the glory of God, so that in a day that is quickly drawing near the whole universe will be filled with divine glory and with the knowledge of God<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#50:1">Page 50</a>   God would have us to know the <b>love</b> of Christ which passeth knowledge that we might be filled unto all the fulness of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#52:14">Page 52</a>   In the kingdom of God we are put under the blessed control of divine grace and <b>love</b> expressed in the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ, so that we may do what is right in the sight of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#56:5">Page 56</a>   It was the place of grace and <b>love</b> and sovereign mercy when human failure was complete and on man's side everything was forfeited.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#57:5">Page 57</a>   He would have companions in the home circle of divine <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#58:17">Page 58</a>   It was necessary for Him to pass out of this world through death in order that we might have a place of association with Him in the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#59:4">Page 59</a>   What marvellous grace and <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#59:12">Page 59</a>   But now we find a blessed company secured by divine <b>love</b> and in divine righteousness able to behold the glory without a veil.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#59:14">Page 59</a>   It is nothing less than the glory of giving effect to all the counsels of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#59:16">Page 59</a>   It is the glory of the Son to bring out and establish the glory of the Father in the fulfilment of all the purposes of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#60:1">Page 60</a>   Christ's "brethren" are the companions of His rejection and reproach in this world, but they are also His companions in the circle of ineffable rest and <b>love</b> where He is with the Father, and where His glory appears.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#60:8">Page 60</a>   I should like the thought to be deepened in our hearts that we have a place in God's house -- in the circle where His <b>love</b> and glory are known -- that we may be drawn more in spirit to dwell there, so as to be still praising Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#61:5">Page 61</a>   If we come under the influence and into the rest of divine <b>love</b> there cannot fail to be a responsive song in our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#64:14">Page 64</a>   When God brings His blessing into the world no doubt Israel will be the centre; but to me the promises unfold what wonderful things the goodness of God will do for men, and that interests me very much, because it makes me acquainted with God and His blessed thoughts of <b>love</b> and mercy.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#66:12">Page 66</a>   "Whom having not seen, ye <b>love</b>; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#67:1">Page 67</a>   It is no good being sentimental; if we really <b>love</b> Christ it will be proved by our wanting to know everything that it is possible to know of Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#67:2">Page 67</a>   Do not tell me people <b>love</b> Christ very much if they neglect their Bibles, or the ministry of the word, or the coming together of the saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#67:17">Page 67</a>   Our hearts are lifted into the blessed scene of liberty and <b>love</b> where Christ is.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#69:11">Page 69</a>  God brings us out of dead religiousness into the vitality of divine <b>love</b>, as we see clearly in verse 22.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#69:16">Page 69</a>   The ring is the symbol of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#69:20">Page 69</a>   <b>Love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#69:23">Page 69</a>   But divine <b>love</b> always embraces others -- it binds us to the brethren<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#70:1">Page 70</a>   It does not say "unfeigned <b>love</b> of divine principles", but "unfeigned <b>love</b> of the brethren".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#70:2">Page 70</a>   It is all very well to <b>love</b> principles; but what strikes me here is that I see a living company -- the brethren.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#70:4">Page 70</a>   Do we <b>love</b> the brethren?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#70:5">Page 70</a>   It is easy to get attached to a system or a peculiar set of doctrines, but the great point is, Do we <b>love</b> the brethren?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#70:6">Page 70</a>  Exercise is called for in relation to this, for we have to lay aside what hinders the activity of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#70:7">Page 70</a>   This is where the test comes to our hearts; are we prepared personally -- am I prepared -- to lay aside what hinders the activity of divine <b>love</b> towards the brethren?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#70:9">Page 70</a>   These things are contrary to brotherly <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#70:10">Page 70</a>   They have to be laid aside, and in this way we are tested as to how much we <b>love</b> the House of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#70:13">Page 70</a>   Are we prepared to lay aside things that hinder the exercise of brotherly <b>love</b>?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#70:15">Page 70</a>  I suggest these few thoughts as to the way in which God brings what is divine into the hearts of His saints; He thus delivers His people from what is fleshly in order to introduce them to a circle where divine <b>love</b> can be active.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#72:5">Page 72</a>   I have been born again, I have been brought into the blessing of the gospel, I have received the Spirit, I am now being formed in holiness and <b>love</b> as one of God's chosen and redeemed people, I have put on a new character.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#72:11">Page 72</a>   We put off the old man, we take the ground of not belonging to that man any more; we are born of incorruptible seed; we are God's redeemed people, and we are being formed in holiness and <b>love</b> as our true character according to God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#73:5">Page 73</a>  If we desire the sincere milk of the word I am sure we shall get it, and our souls will be nourished in the <b>love</b> of God, and God will bring us intelligently into that world of which Christ is the Centre.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#73:6">Page 73</a>   If we <b>love</b> Him we shall surely desire to apprehend all that blessed system of things of which He is the Head and Centre.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#81:13">Page 81</a>   And not only that, but in the very place where sinful flesh was cleared away the glory of God in holiness and <b>love</b> shone forth in all its brightness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#81:16">Page 81</a>   Flesh was removed in judgment; God was revealed in holiness and <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#82:12">Page 82</a>   Our souls are put in the presence of the holiness and <b>love</b> of the blessed God, and we are now called, as Paul says to the Thessalonians, to "walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#82:15">Page 82</a>   But true Christianity is very different to that kind of thing; it is that we are brought into the light of God's holy <b>love</b>, and that becomes the standard of everything.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#83:15">Page 83</a>   God has been turned out of this world, so far as men could do it, but there is a divine Person here who cannot be turned out of the world, and He forms the saints into God's dwelling-place, and the only knowledge of God in grace and righteousness and <b>love</b> the world gets comes through God's house, which is the place where His testimony dwells, and from whence it goes forth.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#86:12">Page 86</a>   There is nothing legal or burdensome about it; God has thrown round our hearts the golden chain of His blessed grace and <b>love</b> that we might be drawn to Him and bound to Him, and that it might become the joy of our hearts to be in intercourse with Him and intercession before Him as to everything here.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#94:3">Page 94</a>  It has been brought before us that the death of Christ is not only the end of man in the flesh, but that the  <b>love</b>  revealed in His death is the formative power of the new man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#94:4">Page 94</a>   We learn the <b>love</b> of God in that precious death, and as we learn it we are formed by it according to God (sec  Ephesians 4:24 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#94:5">Page 94</a>   The effect of the <b>love</b> of God is to form us in "righteousness and holiness of truth", and this is the character of the new man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#95:18">Page 95</a>  In chapter 3 what corresponds with access to the Father is "being rooted and grounded in <b>love</b>", in order that ye "may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height" (verse 18).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#97:2">Page 97</a>   This involves that we become "followers [imitators] of God, as dear children, and walk in <b>love</b>, even as Christ also hath loved us" ( Ephesians 5:1 , 2).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#97:3">Page 97</a>   Nothing could be more blessed than to know God as those who are in the full light of His favour and <b>love</b>, and then to be here to give expression to what He is in the midst of a world of selfishness and hatred and lust -- a world, too, where all are in darkness as to God, and where every serious mind feels the darkness, though pride of heart and will often prevent the acknowledgment of it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#99:1">Page 99</a>   I trust we may with prayerful exercise meditate upon these things, and be greatly enlarged in our knowledge of God, and of the wondrous way in which He is near to us in blessing and <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#99:6">Page 99</a>   I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in <b>love</b>; endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace" ( Ephesians 4:1  - 3).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#100:13">Page 100</a>   All that is in God's mind and heart has been told out by the Son of His <b>love</b>, found in this world as a Man: One able also to secure a perfect answer to it all on the ground of redemption in the deepest blessing of man<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#101:4">Page 101</a>   All that goes to make up the light of God -- <b>love</b>, holiness, righteousness, etc.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#101:7">Page 101</a>   Men <b>love</b> darkness rather than light because they do not wish to judge themselves; but the Christian does not shun the light, he loves to walk in it; and the more light he gets the lower down he goes in self-judgment.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#102:2">Page 102</a>   So far as propitiation is concerned everything is settled, and now the One who has settled everything is entitled to speak in <b>love</b> to the Father about the one who sins, because He has maintained righteousness with regard to the sin.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#102:4">Page 102</a>  The effect of walking in the light and of being cleansed from all unrighteousness is that divine <b>love</b> becomes active in us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#102:8">Page 102</a>   He could say, "As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you", and immediately afterwards, "This is my commandment, That ye <b>love</b> one another as I have loved you" ( John 15:9 , 12).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#102:10">Page 102</a>  The children of God are characterised by these things -- they have joy in the knowledge of divine Persons, and they walk in righteousness and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#103:5">Page 103</a>   <b>Love</b> not the world, neither the things that are in the world.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#103:6">Page 103</a>   If any man <b>love</b> the world, the <b>love</b> of the Father is not in him" ( 1 John 2:14 , 15).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#104:18">Page 104</a>   The Father has in <b>love</b> given us the place of children of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#105:5">Page 105</a>   In that way we come under the Father's <b>love</b>; we come into view as children of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#105:6">Page 105</a>   He has given us capacity to appreciate and <b>love</b> what is delightful to His own heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#105:8">Page 105</a>   We may well say, "Behold what manner of <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#105:11">Page 105</a>   We shall be like Christ in the circle of divine <b>love</b> and complacency for evermore.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#106:7">Page 106</a>   A people marked by righteousness and <b>love</b> must be the children of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#106:11">Page 106</a>   He dwells here in His house, and His house is composed of His children, who come into manifestation as those in whom righteousness and <b>love</b> are expressed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#106:14">Page 106</a>   <b>Love</b> is the spring of righteousness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#106:15">Page 106</a>   All that is  right  is the outcome and activity of the divine nature; it all springs from <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#106:16">Page 106</a>  <b>Love</b> is a thing we have had to learn, because naturally we had no idea of it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#106:17">Page 106</a>   Natural <b>love</b> never gives people a true thought of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#106:18">Page 106</a>   We have to learn that <b>love</b> in the death of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#106:19">Page 106</a>   "Hereby perceive we the <b>love</b>, because he laid down his life for us".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#106:21">Page 106</a>   He speaks of <b>love</b> absolutely -- "God is <b>love</b>" -- and then he shows how it has been manifested toward us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#106:23">Page 106</a>   Herein is <b>love</b>, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins" (verse 9, 10)<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#107:1">Page 107</a>   In God's house we find ourselves in an atmosphere of <b>love</b>; it is the home of <b>love</b> and the school of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#107:2">Page 107</a>   We may only be on the lowest bench in the school, but how blessed it is to know that God has brought us into His house that we may learn and experience His <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#107:3">Page 107</a>   In natural things the home circle is where a child learns <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#107:4">Page 107</a>   Children are born with capacity for affections, but the affections have to be developed in an atmosphere of care and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#107:6">Page 107</a>   But no one could say that the House of God is a cold place; it is filled with the warmth of His blessed <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#107:8">Page 107</a>   As we thus learn divine <b>love</b> and live in it we become capable of expressing it towards one another, and, "if we <b>love</b> one another, God dwelleth in us, and his <b>love</b> is perfected in us".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#107:13">Page 107</a>   But in the epistle it is, "If we <b>love</b> one another, God dwelleth in us".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#107:14">Page 107</a>   The same blessed God who was declared by the only begotten Son now dwells in His children who <b>love</b> one another.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#108:11">Page 108</a>  In God's house His <b>love</b> is known and believed, and His children abiding in <b>love</b> abide in God and God in them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#108:12">Page 108</a>   Fear dwells not in that holy circle; perfect <b>love</b> has expelled it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#108:13">Page 108</a>   God was the first to <b>love</b>, but the effect of His <b>love</b> known in our hearts is that we <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#108:14">Page 108</a>   This great miracle God has brought to pass on earth, that there are those who <b>love</b> Him and His children, and who keep His commandments without finding them to be grievous.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#115:4">Page 115</a>   Times of sorrow and suffering give opportunity for the <b>love</b> and care of the saints to come into activity.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#115:5">Page 115</a>   It is a common thing to hear one say, in reference to some season of great pressure or sorrow, "I never knew before how much <b>love</b> there was in the saints".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#115:6">Page 115</a>   We find the compassion and care and <b>love</b> of God in His children, and in this way we are spiritually enlarged in the very moment of pressure.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#115:11">Page 115</a>   There is always the care of His <b>love</b> behind it all.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#115:13">Page 115</a>  Then, again, it is in trial and sorrow that we learn in an experimental way the sympathy and succour of Christ -- His <b>love</b> as Priest.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#115:20">Page 115</a>   It is all in deep, divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#115:21">Page 115</a>  The pressure of sorrow turns one away from the world and rebukes the natural self-importance of the flesh, and this leaves room for the blessed Lord to come to the heart in all the tenderness of divine sympathy and <b>love</b> to establish a personal link between Himself and the Borrower that could not be formed in any other way<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#116:4">Page 116</a>   But think of the blessed Lord, with perfect knowledge of your sorrow, and of all the detail, of which you would be ashamed to speak to a human being, because it would so expose your weakness that you could hardly expect to be understood, coming near to you in perfect divine <b>love</b> and sympathy  to endear Himself to you  in your need and pressure!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#116:12">Page 116</a>   His <b>love</b> was set upon leading them to Himself in that new place upon which He had entered as the risen One.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#117:5">Page 117</a>   Divine <b>love</b> in Christ touches me where I am in all the reality of my weakness and need, compassed with infirmity, and feeling every sorrow and trial.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#117:7">Page 117</a>   There is this wonderful thing about God's discipline, that it furnishes opportunity for the <b>love</b> of Christ as Priest to touch us where we are, and to so knit us to Himself in affection that we may travel in company with Him to a spot where sorrow and sin can never come.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#118:16">Page 118</a>   The hand of God is in them, and the <b>love</b> of God, and our exercise and prayer should be that we might have grace to profit by them<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#120:2">Page 120</a>   If we find that another line of things tends to develop <b>love</b>, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance, we may be equally sure that is the Spirit's line.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#122:18">Page 122</a>   The death of the Son of God is the mighty voice of divine <b>love</b> to man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#122:19">Page 122</a>   The ruin, need, guilt, and condemnation of man the sinner only serve as the dark background to show in stronger light the <b>love</b> that would reach him and bless him in spite of it all<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#128:8">Page 128</a>   But there are hearts that thrill with joy in the sense of His blessedness and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#128:11">Page 128</a>   It is infinitely better to be the smallest, feeblest babe, to perceive the greatness and glory and <b>love</b> of Christ than to be the most honoured person in the world without any appreciation of Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#129:7">Page 129</a>   Brought into His life and into His relationship, to have part with Him in the Father's <b>love</b> -- sons with Him who is "the firstborn among many brethren" -- His assembly shares His place and glory as the risen and exalted Man.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#132:10">Page 132</a>   If the Father's <b>love</b>, and Christ the blessed Object of that <b>love</b>, are in us we are morally qualified for the service of God in His sanctuary.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#133:2">Page 133</a>   His singing is the suited and divine response to the Father's name and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#133:14">Page 133</a>   He has not only manifested His <b>love</b> in the gift of His beloved Son, but He has given the Holy Spirit as the powerful Witness of His <b>love</b> in our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#133:15">Page 133</a>   We are assured by a divine Witness of the efficacy of Christ's work, and of the unspeakable <b>love</b> of God as the source of all our blessing.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#133:16">Page 133</a>   There is not a cloud on the <b>love</b> of God, or a spot on our consciences to keep us from enjoying it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#133:19">Page 133</a>    The revelation of  God has come out in the death of His Son, who came into death, not only to banish every cloud and remove every spot, but in order that there might be a way paved with divine <b>love</b> over which our souls might travel adoringly into nearness to God<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#134:1">Page 134</a>   It is "a new and living way"; it lives in all the blessedness of divine <b>love</b>, and Christ is the One who has opened it up.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#134:2">Page 134</a>   He had to remove in holy judgment all that we were, but in the very place where He did so He disclosed the depths of the heart of God, that we might live in the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac18.htm#134:4">Page 134</a>   He is the great Centre and power of attraction by which those who <b>love</b> Him are withdrawn from every rival influence and led into the blessed privilege of approach to God.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#9:15">Page 9</a>  I put it to every one here, Do you know the grace and <b>love</b> of God, so that you can trust Him with your happiness?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#10:3">Page 10</a>   Now you may be quite sure that anything you cannot pray for, and that you cannot receive from God in grace and <b>love</b>, will not minister in the smallest degree to your true happiness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#13:8">Page 13</a>  Christ is the Wisdom of God in view of all the questions which sin had raised, and which appeared to make the blessing of man and the accomplishment of the purposes of divine <b>love</b> impossible.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#20:6">Page 20</a>   God is before us -- well known in all-blessing grace and <b>love</b> -- and as Grace reigns in our hearts the power of self-will is broken.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#20:7">Page 20</a>  "The Father's <b>love</b> with joy we own,   Revealed in Christ the Son".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#24:18">Page 24</a>   All that God is has come out in the Person of His Son, and by the cross, so that we may know Him in the depths of His grace and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#25:1">Page 25</a>   He has loved us and does <b>love</b> us with all His heart, and the answer to that <b>love</b>, when it is truly known, is that we trust Him with all our heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#25:2">Page 25</a>   Unreserved <b>love</b>, when it is known, produces unreserved trust.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#25:5">Page 25</a>   As to His  <b>love</b> , He spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#25:7">Page 25</a>   As to His wisdom, He has pledged Himself to make all things work together for good to them who <b>love</b> Him, and who are called according to His purpose.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#28:13">Page 28</a>   Then, "Keep yourselves in the <b>love</b> of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#28:14">Page 28</a>   Here we are viewed as in the confidence of divine <b>love</b> both in the present and as to the future<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#32:6">Page 32</a>   Many stay in Egypt and try to improve the world; many others settle down with an order of worship and service which is according to man in the flesh; while few, comparatively, are like Joshua and Caleb -- set in their hearts to fully follow the Lord, and to enter into the purpose of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#32:11">Page 32</a>   When a brother takes part in a meeting who has something fresh from the Lord -- a fresh sense of divine <b>love</b> in his heart -- it affects everybody, and the Lord is honoured thereby.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#33:14">Page 33</a>   Of such we may well ask John's question, "How dwelleth the <b>love</b> of God in him?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#36:10">Page 36</a>   The recognition of the Lord's <b>LOVE</b> would preserve us from this.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#36:11">Page 36</a>   If we recognise the Lord in it, we shall not despise it; if we recognize His <b>love</b> in it, we shall not faint under it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#36:13">Page 36</a>   The consciousness that the chastening is all the outcome of divine <b>love</b> will preserve us from fainting.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#37:2">Page 37</a>   Many bitter hours of vexation would have been spared him if he had had unwavering confidence in the master's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#37:5">Page 37</a>   Beloved brethren, let us remember that a Master Hand has ordered those exercises for us, and deep eternal <b>love</b> is behind them all.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#37:6">Page 37</a>   How blessed to be able to look upon every trial and difficulty, upon every pressure and cause of exercise, as an express token of the Lord's <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#37:7">Page 37</a>   We feel it to be "not joyous, but grievous"; it is a very real check upon us -- it would not profit us if it were not; but we know the <b>love</b> that is behind it, and this is enough.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#37:11">Page 37</a>   He seeks to confirm their hearts in the assurance of divine <b>love</b>, as the great preservative against the tendency to faint.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#38:6">Page 38</a>   "<b>Love</b> not the world", says the Holy Ghost, "neither the things that are in the world.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#38:7">Page 38</a>   If any man <b>love</b> the world, the <b>love</b> of the Father is not in him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#38:14">Page 38</a>   Satan is ever seeking to get something into our hearts that will divert us from Christ -- that will draw us away from "first <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#42:6">Page 42</a>   A divine Person was needed to do that, and in <b>love</b> and grace He came to do it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#42:15">Page 42</a>   the heart of God took in the whole world in thoughts of <b>love</b> and grace, and the atonement was equal to the mighty scope of that <b>love</b> and grace.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#44:9">Page 44</a>   Young believer, great is your dignity, and many are your privileges, because of the greatness of the position and relationship to which divine <b>love</b> has called you.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#44:10">Page 44</a>   We may well exclaim, "Behold, what manner of <b>love</b> the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the children of God" ( 1 John 3:1 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#50:10">Page 50</a>   To such the solemn warning is addressed, "<b>Love</b> not the world, neither the things that are in the world.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#50:11">Page 50</a>   If any man <b>love</b> the world, the <b>love</b> of the Father is not in him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#53:4">Page 53</a>   Verse 15 suggests the answer, for we read, "If any man <b>love</b> the world, the <b>love</b> of the Father is not in him".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#53:5">Page 53</a>   If the <b>love</b> of the Father is in us it becomes a divine preservative from the world.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#54:8">Page 54</a>   "If any man <b>love</b> the world, the <b>love</b> of the Father is not in him".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#57:16">Page 57</a>   Faith now finds the surest footing in death, because He has died in the most blessed grace and <b>love</b>, that God might be known to us as a Saviour God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#60:10">Page 60</a>   It was in boundless divine <b>love</b> and grace that He became a Sacrifice for sin.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#60:16">Page 60</a>   And not only has that precious death removed sinful flesh, but it has become to our wondering souls the revelation of God's grace and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#61:2">Page 61</a>  But the <b>love</b> which was manifested in death still subsists in the Son of God risen and glorified, and by that <b>love</b> He binds us to Himself on the resurrection side of death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#66:7">Page 66</a>   I speak not -- for the moment -- of atonement, but of all those ceaseless activities of grace, in which He was the Servant of Jehovah's pleasure, and the Son of His Father's <b>love</b> as a Man upon the earth.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#67:1">Page 67</a>  Then I trust every heart in this company has lingered with adoring thoughts of faith and <b>love</b> in presence of the work accomplished on the cross.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#67:10">Page 67</a>  A SORROWING HEART His first action -- and surely <b>love</b> would have it so -- was to meet and satisfy the longings of a heart that had no object but Himself<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#68:4">Page 68</a>   that we may treasure them in our hearts -- "He that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will <b>love</b> him, and will manifest myself to Him" ( John 14:21 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#68:6">Page 68</a>   She loved Him, and her <b>love</b> called forth the expression of His.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#68:12">Page 68</a>   Has the treasure we have found in His <b>love</b> really separated our hearts from everything here?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#69:16">Page 69</a>   It was nothing but Himself, and the consciousness of His presence and <b>love</b> borne into her heart, as the well-known Shepherd's voice called His sheep by name.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#70:3">Page 70</a>   It was to a heart like that the blessed Lord could make communications which surpass all human thought -- to such a heart He could unfold what divine <b>love</b> would do for its own delight in the blessing of its objects.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#70:4">Page 70</a>  Her <b>love</b>  would have kept Him here, and been content to follow Him still as the Messiah upon earth; rejected and dishonoured indeed, but still to her the chiefest among ten thousand and altogether lovely.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#70:5">Page 70</a>   But His <b>love</b> had its own secrets, and He tenderly set aside her thoughts that He might replace them by His own.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#70:10">Page 70</a>   He has those in this world whom He owns as His brethren -- His Father is their Father, and His God is their God, and His <b>love</b> would have them to know this new place of association with Himself as the Risen One.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#71:3">Page 71</a>   If not, depend upon it we have not really taken in the thoughts of His <b>love</b>, and it may be the Lord has not found in us that freshness of affection for Himself that would set Him free to communicate those thoughts to us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#71:12">Page 71</a>   Instead of holy thirstings after Christ, and the joy of His <b>love</b>, there is nothing in their soul's secret history but sadness and reproach.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#72:13">Page 72</a>   He loved the Lord, and he was confident in the strength of his <b>love</b>, and he needed to learn what a bruised reed he was.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#73:9">Page 73</a>   We know not what passed at that private interview, but I will venture to say that there was so much confession on Simon's part, and so much tender and gracious <b>love</b> on the Lord's part, that when the Lord and Simon met again, within the closed doors in the evening, no uneasiness or shyness remained to hinder Simon from enjoying the presence of his Lord.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#73:10">Page 73</a>  If there is a Peter here tonight -- one who has failed, and dishonoured the Lord -- I can tell you that that dishonoured Lord loves you still, and it would give His heart great joy to remove the soil from your conscience and to make you happy in His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#73:15">Page 73</a>   He makes you conscious of your sin, but He does not fail to assure your heart of the constancy of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#74:1">Page 74</a>   Every link bears the stamp of divine and changeless <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#74:7">Page 74</a>   Make a clean breast of the whole matter; go to the very bottom of it with Him; and you will find that He will remove the shade from your heart and the stain from your conscience, and give you a deeper sense of His <b>love</b> than you ever had before.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#78:1">Page 78</a>  May we better understand that it is the purpose of His <b>love</b> to have us here for Himself, and that all the wonderful grace that meets us in our need -- whether it be that of the sorrowing heart, the soiled conscience or the straying feet -- is bent upon dealing with us in such a way as to free us for Himself and for His own company!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#82:19">Page 82</a>  "He will rest in his <b>love</b>; he will joy over thee with singing".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#83:1">Page 83</a>   He can rest in what His own <b>love</b> has accomplished.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#83:6">Page 83</a>   He will display us to wondering worlds as the objects of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#85:10">Page 85</a>   "Thus saith the Lord, I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the <b>love</b> of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#86:9">Page 86</a>   It was what Jehovah could remember and speak of more than eight hundred years afterwards as "the kindness of thy youth, the <b>love</b> of thine espousals".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#88:6">Page 88</a>   It was the kindness of your youth and the <b>love</b> of your espousals.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#88:11">Page 88</a>   It is thus -- and only thus -- that Christ has His true satisfaction in us, for if the day of espousal yields deep and holy joy to us, it yields a deeper and a fuller joy to Him, whose matchless <b>love</b> has drawn forth the responsive affection of our hearts<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#92:8">Page 92</a>   the Lord looks back to those hours of holy joy, of absorbing affection, of burning <b>love</b>; and He says, "I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the <b>love</b> of thine espousals".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#93:12">Page 93</a>   The secret of all His gracious dealings with us lies in the fact that He loves us, and nothing but <b>love</b> will satisfy <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#93:13">Page 93</a>   He is jealous over us; He must have the affection of our hearts; He values it; it is the chosen satisfaction of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#94:3">Page 94</a>   That advocacy, which is in all the value of His own nearness to the Father and based upon His sin-atoning work, is the unfailing outcome of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#94:4">Page 94</a>   Our sin becomes the immediate occasion for His <b>love</b> to concern itself on our behalf, and this with the Father.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#94:7">Page 94</a>   Nevertheless I have against thee, that thou hast left thy first <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#94:9">Page 94</a>   Here we have ministry, or the Lord's voice, addressing itself to those whose hearts had left their first <b>love</b>, and seeking to call them to repentance.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#95:2">Page 95</a>   But the <b>love</b> of their espousals had waned; they had left the bright "first <b>love</b>" to which Christ Himself was everything.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#95:7">Page 95</a>   We have already seen how the Lord remembers the "first <b>love</b>" of His saints; He delights to call it to mind; and He counts upon it being also a sweet memory to the hearts of His own.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#95:8">Page 95</a>   This is the first effort of His restoring grace -- to recall the memory of those precious hours when the holy rapture of "first <b>love</b>" filled the heart, and He was really everything to the soul.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#95:10">Page 95</a>   Have you to look back through the mist of intervening years to find a moment of deep joy in which Christ filled the whole vision of your soul, and His <b>love</b> satisfied every longing of your heart?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#95:11">Page 95</a>   Sorrowfully, but in tender <b>love</b>, the Lord calls you now to "remember".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#96:1">Page 96</a>   May the voice of the Lord really reach and recall in power every heart that has left its first <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#96:5">Page 96</a>   It is, so to speak, the Lord inviting us to return to the happiness and intimacy of "first <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#96:8">Page 96</a>   Yet we must needs return in a way that really sets us free in the presence of His <b>love</b> from the things that had diverted us from Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#96:12">Page 96</a>   This is a deep, solemn, searching process, but infinite <b>love</b> calls us into it, and will carry us through it if we respond to that call.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#97:3">Page 97</a>   The result of it is that we are brought back, with a deepened knowledge of self and a truer judgment of the world, to find our entire satisfaction in the unchanging <b>love</b> of His heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#97:4">Page 97</a>   We are brought back to the freshness and simplicity of that "first <b>love</b>" to which Christ is everything.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#99:21">Page 99</a>   Poor backsliding Israel, after more than 3,000 years of wandering and rebellion, will be brought back to the kindness of her youth, and to the <b>love</b> of her espousals.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#100:2">Page 100</a>   Beloved brethren, if this is the manner of His grace to Israel, surely our hearts are entitled to appropriate its sweetness to ourselves, who are called, through infinite <b>love</b>, to know Him in a closer relationship.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#100:3">Page 100</a>   I know that when the heart has long been a stranger to the joy of first <b>love</b>, there is a great tendency to settle down and go on with things as they are, as though it were hopeless to expect to be restored.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#100:5">Page 100</a>   You will awake to the blessed reality of the fact that He yearns over you in rich and boundless <b>love</b>, and that He is ready to lead you into communion with Himself in the judgment of the things that have turned you aside, and of yourself for giving them a place in your thoughts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#100:6">Page 100</a>   Your heart will leap for joy to think that His <b>love</b> is really unchanged.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#100:7">Page 100</a>   Thus restored, "first <b>love</b>", with all that it means for you and for Him, will again fill your heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#102:5">Page 102</a>   Well, it is a great thing to have such a desire, because it shows that we <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#102:8">Page 102</a>  "If ye <b>love</b> me, keep my commandments.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#102:10">Page 102</a>   This is the first mention, I believe, in the gospel, of the disciples' <b>love</b> for the Son of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#102:11">Page 102</a>   And He prays the Father for the gift of the Comforter in distinct connection with the fact that there is a company here of those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#102:12">Page 102</a>   Now, I say to the youngest believer here, the very fact that you desire to be here for Christ shows that you belong to the company of those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#103:2">Page 103</a>   I believe the first awakening of <b>love</b> to the Son of God is when He establishes a personal link between Himself and our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#103:7">Page 103</a>   It is not a question of how much doctrine we know, but how much are our hearts exulting with great joy in the blessed fact that a divine Person, the Son of God, has made us conscious of His <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#103:8">Page 103</a>   Think of Him coming into this world to bring to us all the favour, and blessing, and joy that divine <b>love</b> could offer, and securing it for us by an act that puts the seal of His <b>love</b> for ever on our hearts!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#103:9">Page 103</a>   He went into death that His <b>love</b> might be known by our hearts!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#103:11">Page 103</a>   It is in the apprehension of this that, we become conscious of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#103:13">Page 103</a>   The effect of this is that we <b>love</b> Him; we cannot help it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#103:16">Page 103</a>   But I believe what marked them, and made them precious to the Father and to Him, was that they were conscious of His <b>love</b>, and they were bound to Him in affection.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#104:5">Page 104</a>   Has He so put the seal of His <b>love</b> on our hearts -- so established His <b>love</b> there -- that He has become everything to us, and all outside Him is a blank?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#104:11">Page 104</a>   He had brought divine <b>love</b> to them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#104:12">Page 104</a>  In  John 14  the Lord regards His disciples as a company in whom there is response to His <b>love</b>, and He says, "If ye <b>love</b> me, keep my commandments.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#104:14">Page 104</a>   The gift of the Comforter is in distinct connection with the fact that we <b>love</b> Him, and it is the blessed mission of the Comforter to maintain our hearts in affection for the absent One.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#104:18">Page 104</a>   If we are not delivered from the influence of these things they will greatly hamper us, and hinder the response of our hearts to divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#105:10">Page 105</a>   The world may seem very attractive with its vast political machinery, its great educational schemes, and its philanthropic institutions; but, beloved friends, it is exposed for those who <b>love</b> the Son of God in the very fact that it has rejected Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#105:11">Page 105</a>   For those who <b>love</b> Him the world is thoroughly exposed; we have no respect for its pretensions; our hearts have broken with it and are free from its influence, because the Person who has made Himself everything to us has not found a bit of response in it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#106:16">Page 106</a>   That is, He was going out of the sphere of sight, but as an unseen Person He would have His own to be linked with Him in faith and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#107:1">Page 107</a>   It is a great thing for us to be in some measure delivered from these things, for it is only as we are thus delivered that we really enter into the thoughts of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#107:2">Page 107</a>  The Son of God has brought divine <b>love</b> here.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#107:4">Page 107</a>   Everything that is not the outcome of divine <b>love</b> will break down sooner or later, and we do well to take this to heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#107:5">Page 107</a>   But there is something that cannot break down -- that cannot fail -- and that is divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#107:6">Page 107</a>   I am sure the effect of knowing even a little of this <b>love</b> is to greatly draw us to the blessed Person who has brought it to us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#107:10">Page 107</a>   But I should like to ask, Do you know what it is to get near to the Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God, that He may lead your heart into the blessedness of His own <b>love</b>?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#107:11">Page 107</a>   He may give us a taste of that <b>love</b>, as it were, at a distance, but it is in order to draw us to Himself, that we may learn it fully in His own company.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#107:12">Page 107</a>   Satan will do his best to divert us by all possible means from entering into this, but if our hearts have really come under the power of divine <b>love</b> we shall not be diverted.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#107:13">Page 107</a>   John had come under the power of that blessed <b>love</b>, and responded to it, leaning on Jesus' bosom.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#107:14">Page 107</a>   It seems to me that  John 13  is the school of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#107:15">Page 107</a>   The Master teaches divine <b>love</b> in perfection; the disciple learns with his head pillowed on that Master's bosom; and the result of the learning is that the disciples can be told to "<b>Love</b> one another as I have loved you"<br>
<a href="../cac/cac19.htm#108:1">Page 108</a>  What a wonderful thing it is to get into His company to learn there how He loves; because His <b>love</b> does not ignore what the flesh is, nor does it forget our liability to be influenced and defiled by what is around us here.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#3:8">Page 3</a>   God puts Christ before sinners -- the Son of His <b>love</b>, the blessed Victim of Calvary, now the risen and glorified One and through HIM proclaims forgiveness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#12:13">Page 12</a>   He is warned, if he thinks that he stands secure, to take heed lest he fall; he is warned against the deceitfulness of sin and the wiles of the devil; he is solemnly exhorted not to <b>love</b> the world, and to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#20:2">Page 20</a>   Here we are confronted with a problem which only divine wisdom and <b>love</b> could solve, a problem which has found its solution, to God's eternal praise and glory, in  the death of Christ , which is THE RIGHTEOUS GROUND OF JUSTIFICATION.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#21:7">Page 21</a>   But in wondrous and blessed contrast to this we see the manifestation of God's thoughts of blessing in the fact that Christ has in <b>love</b> become subject to the judgment which lay upon man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#21:9">Page 21</a>   But at the same time the way in which this judgment of sin has come about gives expression to the infinite <b>love</b> of God, for the judgment has been borne by One who came into it as sent and moved by divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#21:11">Page 21</a>   The "guilty" has not been "cleared"; on the contrary, judgment has come upon him to the uttermost, but in the person of One who has borne that judgment in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#28:7">Page 28</a>   In short, he has acquired a new moral constitution by learning righteousness and <b>love</b> in the death of Christ, and by coming into the presence of all that grace and moral perfection which is set forth in the Lord Jesus Christ, all of which he enters into in the power of the Holy Ghost given to him to this end.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#28:10">Page 28</a>   He fulfils the righteous requirement of the law, and brings forth the fruit of the Spirit -- "<b>love</b>, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#32:9">Page 32</a>   None could do it but Himself, and He has done it in <b>love</b>, that He might bring divine <b>love</b> to us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#32:12">Page 32</a>   the  darkness  of the cross is for ever past, and  now  as we look there we see  glory  and  <b>love</b> .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#32:13">Page 32</a>   We see  the glory of God  there; all that He is in majesty, truth, and holiness, as against sin, is fully declared there; and yet there is the most blessed manifestation of His  <b>love</b> .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#35:2">Page 35</a>   I would seek in every way to cultivate divine sensitiveness of conscience -- the spiritual ability to recognize and judge whatever is contrary to divine light and <b>love</b> in ourselves.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#37:4">Page 37</a>   It is thus that I am in conscious suitability to divine light and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#37:6">Page 37</a>  On the other hand, my heart is attracted by the perfections and blessedness of that new state in which  Man  is found absolutely suitable to all the thoughts and <b>love</b> of God -- a state in which only ONE MAN is yet found actually.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#39:5">Page 39</a>  ) Beloved brethren, let us watch the  beginnings  of decline, let us make haste to judge the spiritual sloth, the self-confidence, the inward departure from first <b>love</b> that steal almost imperceptibly over our hearts, and prepare us to admit suggestions of self-gratification which would otherwise never approach us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#41:3">Page 41</a>   It is the glorious purpose of divine <b>love</b>, and infinitely transcends every conception of blessing that could be formed in our minds.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#41:7">Page 41</a>   Indeed, there is but one Person in whom you can learn the exceeding greatness and blessedness of your place according to the <b>love</b> and purpose of God, and that is the Son of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#41:11">Page 41</a>   They are either pursuing, or are satisfied with, something less than that which divine <b>love</b> proposes, and thus they are losers to an incalculable extent.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#42:12">Page 42</a>   I do not undervalue service, and I thank God for every true servant, but I am sure that  the first thing in the mind of God  is to bring us to Himself -- into the enjoyment of His favour, which is better than life -- into the real liberty and satisfaction of heart in divine <b>love</b> which is connected with Acceptance.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#43:8">Page 43</a>   The remedy for this kind of self-occupation is to know the <b>love</b> and support of Christ as Priest.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#43:10">Page 43</a>   In His <b>love</b> He makes His sympathy a reality to our hearts, and the fact that He considers our trouble and has known our soul in adversity as One touched with the feeling of our infirmities, having been in all points tempted like as we are apart from sin, draws our hearts to Him in a very blessed way.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#43:11">Page 43</a>   In nearness to Himself we enjoy His <b>love</b>, and are assured of His support, and the moment our hearts come consciously into the circle of His <b>love</b> self is no longer the centre.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#43:14">Page 43</a>   There is the positive support of His <b>love</b>; and thus our weakness becomes the occasion of proving the personal <b>love</b> and support of Christ, so that we are sustained in the joy of God's favour.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#43:15">Page 43</a>   We are sensible that we need support -- that the <b>love</b> of Christ in this blessed way is an indispensable necessity -- but we may have the support that we need.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#43:16">Page 43</a>   The <b>love</b> of Christ makes it available for us; His known <b>love</b> is the sure pledge of it to our hearts<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#44:11">Page 44</a>   God would have us to enjoy His favour, which is better than life, and to know the answer in our souls to the wondrous desire, "that the <b>love</b> wherewith thou halt loved me may be in them, and I in them".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#50:18">Page 50</a>   Yet we should learn this not as a thing to sorrow over as if we regretted it, but as a privilege, for it is in death that He has brought divine <b>love</b> to us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#56:10">Page 56</a>   Are you drawn in affection to Christ in that new world of light and <b>love</b> where He lives unto God?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#60:10">Page 60</a>   A wife would count upon having the  company , the  <b>love</b> , and the support of her husband.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#60:12">Page 60</a>   To be married to Christ is to have  His company , the enjoyment of  His <b>love</b> , and the constant assurance of  His support .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#61:5">Page 61</a>   On His side, there was a <b>love</b> that nothing could stay.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#61:6">Page 61</a>   Faithfulness was there too, but it was the faithfulness of an all-prevailing <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#61:12">Page 61</a>   In this way God would lead our hearts into company with Christ, and I am sure this would be a good cure for legality, for we could not be near Him without learning  His <b>love</b> , and a heart breathing the atmosphere of divine <b>love</b> could not be legal.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#61:13">Page 61</a>  How did John learn the <b>love</b> of Christ?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#61:16">Page 61</a>   John is like that planet; we do not see much of him, but when he does appear it is in the bright light of the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#67:12">Page 67</a>   We <b>love</b> the brethren; the saints become to us the excellent of the earth; and thus, in the exercise of those affections which are of the divine nature, we find deliverance from the flesh.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#68:12">Page 68</a>   Thus walking in <b>love</b> and holiness, we are maintained in superiority to all the evil that naturally attaches to us as children of Adam.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#70:10">Page 70</a>   So that instead of the murmurs of the wilderness being in the heart and on the tongue, the glories, perfections, and <b>love</b> of Christ so fill the heart that when the mouth opens streams of refreshing and gladness flow forth as in  Psalm 45 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#71:6">Page 71</a>   Would to God that we were a little more earnest in our desire to enter into the purpose of His <b>love</b>, for if there were a little desire on our part there would be a great answer of blessing on God's part.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#73:4">Page 73</a>   When you saw that your sins were all put away, and that God imputed righteousness to you -- righteousness the measure and expression of which is Christ risen -- ,you entered into peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, and received the Spirit, who shed the <b>love</b> of God abroad in your heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#73:11">Page 73</a>   We sang with triumph of His <b>love</b>, we exulted in His grace, and in some true, if small, measure we did "joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ".<br>

<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#79:6">Page 79</a>   We are then able to leave self altogether behind, and to enter the atmosphere of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#79:8">Page 79</a>    <b>Love</b>  thinks more of the Giver than His gifts -- more of the <b>love</b> than of the work which <b>love</b> has wrought.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#86:3">Page 86</a>   If our hearts are not in the circle of divine <b>love</b> they have really got  nothing , for as Christians we have no portion on earth or in the world; our portion is in divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#86:9">Page 86</a>   As to this world the disciples had lost everything and gained nothing, but to compensate for this they got divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#86:10">Page 86</a>   Many are content to have assurance of pardon and eternal security, without forsaking all to follow a rejected Christ; that is, they have not in heart and spirit broken with the world, and they do not know what it is to have a portion in divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#87:3">Page 87</a>   Jesus came  from God  into a world of sin, of man's ruin, of Satan's triumph, and of God's grief and dishonour; and He has secured everything  for God , so that He could go back  to God  as the One who has removed every hindrance to the full display and triumph of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#87:7">Page 87</a>   Let us seek to enter into what that death was for God, and into the wondrous blessings of divine <b>love</b> for which it opens the way according to the counsel and purpose of the heart of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#87:8">Page 87</a>   The work of Christ is infinitely great in moral grandeur as the everlasting basis on which the purposes of divine <b>love</b> are secured, and it is from this point of view that it is presented to us in John's gospel.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#87:9">Page 87</a>   Let us turn to five scriptures which bring before us some of the things that have been secured for the satisfaction of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#88:4">Page 88</a>   The magnitude and scope of it are beyond us, but surely the feeblest heart will rejoice to know that a world of bliss has been secured for God -- a world where divine <b>love</b> will have eternal satisfaction and rest -- all secured by Jesus, who will be the Centre and Sun of that universe of bliss.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#88:15">Page 88</a>   The Father and the Son wanted the sheep for themselves, and the death of Christ is the righteous title of divine <b>love</b> to take possession, and to keep possession, of them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#88:16">Page 88</a>   The Father and the Son wanted a company whom they might introduce to the circle of divine <b>love</b>, with a nature suitable to that circle, and capable of appreciating and responding to it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#88:19">Page 88</a>   But the sheep are held on the ground of redemption, they are partakers of the divine nature, and they are secured for the satisfaction of divine <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#89:4">Page 89</a>   If we are left here a little longer we shall need the grace, mercy, and forbearance of God in a thousand ways, but all that will be needed in the future to keep us for the Father and the Son is small compared with the stupendous cost at which divine <b>love</b> secured us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#89:5">Page 89</a>   "Hereby perceive we <b>love</b>, because he laid down his life for us" ( 1 John 3:16 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#89:7">Page 89</a>   In the company secured by divine <b>love</b> there can be no fleshly distinctions.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#90:19">Page 90</a>   The Last Adam came from God, secured everything  for God , and has gone  to God  as the glorified Head of a new race brought into divine <b>love</b> in association with Himself, and Head of a new creation in which all the thoughts of that <b>love</b> will be effected and displayed for ever.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#91:5">Page 91</a>   Those far-reaching realms of light and glory are fitly inherited by Him who has put them all in suitability to divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#91:9">Page 91</a>   the portion of our hearts is  divine <b>love</b> .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#92:12">Page 92</a>   His heart is bound to that company in inconceivable <b>love</b>; it is His peculiar treasure -- the "pearl of great price" to obtain which "he sold all that he had" ( Matthew 13:46 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#92:13">Page 92</a>   Indeed, the consideration of all that is involved in being "his own" would carry our hearts over the whole range of divine grace, and would lead us in a wonderful way into the thoughts of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#92:17">Page 92</a>   In the thoughts of divine <b>love</b> we are of such value as to be a suitable gift from the Father to the Son -- a gift worthy of the Giver and the Receiver<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#93:1">Page 93</a>   We shall be for ever the expression to the Son of the Father's <b>love</b> to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#93:11">Page 93</a>   He has an indisputable right to us, for He has redeemed us, and in doing so has proved that His <b>love</b> was "strong as death".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#93:13">Page 93</a>   There can never be such an  expression  of His <b>love</b> again, but the  <b>love</b>  that thus expressed itself remains unchanged.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#93:17">Page 93</a>   In perfect contrast to this there was divine <b>love</b>, divine light, and divine lowliness in Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#94:10">Page 94</a>   Nothing can measure this <b>love</b>; no sounding-line can fathom it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#94:11">Page 94</a>   If we had, like Paul, "suffered the loss of all things" here, would not His <b>love</b> be a sufficient compensation?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#94:12">Page 94</a>   Rebecca lost her own country, but she got Isaac's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#94:13">Page 94</a>   The servant could speak of "flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses" ( Genesis 24:35 ), but you may depend upon it that Isaac's <b>love</b> was the great thing to Rebecca.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#94:14">Page 94</a>   We are often occupied with our blessings, but the great thing is the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#94:15">Page 94</a>   And this <b>love</b> never fails.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#94:18">Page 94</a>   It would be a natural thing for such a company to go out of the world, as Jesus was about to do, for "his own" are in the circle of divine <b>love</b>, and there is nothing in the world that answers to that <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#95:1">Page 95</a>   Left in the world, and yet within the circle of divine <b>love</b>; that is, belonging to the very circle into which Jesus has gone.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#95:6">Page 95</a>   It is a circle of heavenly <b>love</b>, but we come within it even here.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#95:9">Page 95</a>   If we were altogether in the circle of divine affections, divine <b>love</b> could rest in our undisturbed blessing.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#95:11">Page 95</a>   And therefore so long as we are in the world divine <b>love</b> cannot rest; that <b>love</b> must needs consider all these contrary and hindering elements, and must serve in its solicitude to maintain us in the enjoyment of, and in suitability to, that heavenly circle to which we belong.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#95:13">Page 95</a>  Divine <b>love</b> considers everything -- knows what the world is -- knows what we are -- and loves to the end.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#95:14">Page 95</a>   It is an out-and-out <b>love</b> -- <b>love</b> in spite of everything.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#95:19">Page 95</a>   Nothing can turn that <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#96:2">Page 96</a>   On the other hand, it is as "knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God", that He rises and girds Himself for His service of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#96:3">Page 96</a>   The greatness and glory of which He was so perfectly conscious give an inexpressible depth of meaning to this unique act of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#96:4">Page 96</a>   Their condition, too, perfectly known by Him, did not stay that <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#96:5">Page 96</a>   He knew that one would deny Him, and all forsake Him -- the treachery of Judas and the weakness of Peter were alike before Him -- but His <b>love</b> retired, if we may so say, into itself, and acted altogether from itself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#96:15">Page 96</a>  I must again remind you of the fact that, although we belong to the circle of divine <b>love</b>, we are still "in the world".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#96:16">Page 96</a>   The Lord is altogether in the circle of divine <b>love</b> -- He has gone to the Father -- and as our hearts enter into that circle we have part with Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#97:1">Page 97</a>   We are entitled to be in the circle of divine <b>love</b>; divine grace has called us into it; and as being partakers of the divine nature we are of that circle; we are of it as belonging to the Father and the Son; and yet it is not less true that the blessed Lord says to each one of us, "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#97:2">Page 97</a>   There is an absolute necessity for this service of <b>love</b> to maintain our hearts in freedom from the influences of the world, and in such superiority to all that is incidental to our present condition, that in heart and spirit we may really enter the circle of divine affections, and have part with Him who has gone to the Father.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#97:13">Page 97</a>   So far from the defilement of  John 13  being actual failure or sin, I believe the most spiritual person is the one who will most appreciate this service of <b>love</b> -- he is the one who will have the deepest sense of the need of having his feet washed<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#100:3">Page 100</a>   It furnishes Him with opportunity to give continual expression to His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#100:4">Page 100</a>   But for this ministry of divine <b>love</b> our contact with the world, and our susceptibility to the influences of this present scene, would have the effect of permanently withdrawing our hearts from part with Christ in the circle of divine affections.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#100:6">Page 100</a>   May He be graciously pleased to draw us near to Himself, and give our hearts a deeper sense of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#100:11">Page 100</a>   He brings Himself and His <b>love</b> before our hearts, and thus He displaces the dust of the world.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#100:12">Page 100</a>   It is a distinct service -- the special service of His <b>love</b> while we are in the world.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#100:14">Page 100</a>   No doubt this service of <b>love</b> is for all "his own", but we ought to be exercised as to whether we have been in a condition to get the good of it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#100:15">Page 100</a>   One must be consciously of "his own", and have the world as a judged thing, before he can realize the good of this precious service of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#101:3">Page 101</a>   Do we not often read the Word and pray without turning to the Lord for His present and personal ministry of <b>love</b>?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#101:5">Page 101</a>   If we have part with Him we shall <b>love</b> His own, and we shall wash their feet.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#101:6">Page 101</a>   Those who taste the joys of that circle of divine affections cannot help longing that others should have their feet cleansed from the dust of the world, that they might enjoy their true portion according to the thoughts of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#101:9">Page 101</a>   But if my feet have been washed the <b>love</b> of Christ and of the Father are known in my heart -- I am in the circle of divine affections -- and I naturally speak of the things that are in that circle.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#101:14">Page 101</a>   We must know the thoughts of divine <b>love</b> to understand this precious service of Christ; and I shall be thankful if the Lord uses His word tonight to lead us a little more into those thoughts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#102:13">Page 102</a>   He has come out to reveal Himself in supreme and sovereign <b>love</b> in the very place of sin and death<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#103:2">Page 103</a>   There is necessity for Him to wear that sacrificial title, for He came to bring the testimony of divine <b>love</b> into DEATH.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#103:4">Page 103</a>   Everyone who is in the light of this blessed fact, that the Son of God has assumed the title of Lamb of God, must be conscious that by His doing so a divine solution of the whole question of sin was absolutely ensured, and this in the way of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#103:7">Page 103</a>   We are in the light of the blessed revelation of Himself; divine <b>love</b> has been presented to us in its supremacy and sovereignty in the fact that He has gone into death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#104:6">Page 104</a>   But at the same time we shall be in the presence of divine <b>love</b> that could go even unto death to remove sin, and to reveal itself to our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#104:8">Page 104</a>   We should follow the Lamb of God through death into His own circle, where there is no trace of sin, where there is nothing to dim the shining of "<b>love</b> supreme and bright".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#104:10">Page 104</a>   He says, "Come and see"; He would have us to know the place of His abode, and if we miss this we miss the very kernel of Christianity -- the crowning privilege and blessing of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#104:11">Page 104</a>   The whole work of grace in our souls, the Father's activity in sovereign <b>love</b>, the drawings of His gracious power, are all with a view to our introduction to this blessed association with His Son.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#107:14">Page 107</a>   The Son of God has come down from heaven that He might throw the golden chain of divine <b>love</b> round our hearts and link us with Himself for ever.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#122:2">Page 122</a>   Then, again, if we suffer, as many of us do in one way or another -- chastening for sin and folly -- let us not be discouraged and depressed by it, but rather let us rejoice that the <b>love</b> of God is set upon our being "partakers of his holiness".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#125:13">Page 125</a>   I can say to every repentant sinner -- to every believer in Jesus -- that not only is every barrier righteously removed, but the way in which they have been removed is the most wonderful and blessed testimony to  the <b>love</b> of God .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#125:14">Page 125</a>   "God commendeth his <b>love</b> toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us" ( Romans 5:8 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#127:2">Page 127</a>   And this shows that they must have had a sense of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#127:3">Page 127</a>   They might not have been able to explain it, but His <b>love</b> had established itself in their hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#127:4">Page 127</a>   It is  <b>love</b>  that desires the company of its object.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#127:5">Page 127</a>   The Father was drawing them to Christ by giving them a sense of the blessedness and <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#127:17">Page 127</a>   Or do they find us occupied with the ledger, the newspaper, with a thousand things that pertain to this life and to the world, so that -- though we may sometimes sigh in the weariness of our way, and the Spirit of God may occasionally turn our souls heavenward with desire to breathe the atmosphere of divine <b>love</b> in the company of Christ -- it cannot be said that we really "seek" His company at all?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#128:3">Page 128</a>   He will cause those that <b>love</b> Him to "inherit substance", and He will "fill their treasures"; and He says, "Those that seek me early shall find me".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#128:4">Page 128</a>   May it be ours to take advantage of His <b>love</b>, and to seek His company, so that, going after Him with purpose of heart, we may be able to answer His challenge in the spirit of the earnest inquiry, "Master, where dwellest THOU?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#128:9">Page 128</a>   The glory that attracted the hearts of the two disciples to that Blessed One was a  moral  glory -- a glory of divine perfections and <b>love</b> which only anointed eyes could discern or appreciate -- and the place "where he dwelt" speaks to our hearts of a moral dwelling-place suited to Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#128:10">Page 128</a>   In a word, the two disciples wanted to know Him  in His own circle , and His <b>love</b> conferred upon them the freedom of that circle.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#129:1">Page 129</a>   It cannot be said that she was strong in  faith  or  hope , but she stands conspicuous for <b>LOVE</b> to His blessed Person.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#129:5">Page 129</a>   And the same Voice that had said, "Come and see", opened up to her a new world of everlasting <b>love</b>, and brought her consciously into a new association with Himself outside all the desolation of this scene of death, as by the one word "Mary" He called her into the presence of His unchanged and living <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#129:14">Page 129</a>   His death has ended our history before God as in the flesh, and divested us in the presence of infinite <b>love</b> of every trace of unsuitability to that <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#130:3">Page 130</a>   Well may we adore Him for the triumphs of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#130:4">Page 130</a>  "In the triumph and the glory  Of Thy rest in <b>love</b> divine,  Thou dost tell the wondrous story  How God's counsels made us Thine;" "How by dying Thou hast freed us  From the man of sin and shame,  That, unhindered, Thou might'st lead us  Now to know Thy Father's name".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#130:9">Page 130</a>   Their hearts were illuminated by His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#130:14">Page 130</a>   Can you imagine what the church would have been if she had maintained her first <b>love</b>?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#130:15">Page 130</a>   A company of hearts espoused to Christ, and satisfied with His company and <b>love</b>, and walking in Strangership and rejection here in loyalty to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#130:18">Page 130</a>   This scripture is of great importance because it brings together in one view (1) the first <b>love</b> of the church, (2) the decline of that <b>love</b>, and (3) the awakening and revival thereof so as to make the wise virgins "ready" for the return of the Bridegroom<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#131:7">Page 131</a>   This is the great characteristic of first <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#131:10">Page 131</a>   How soon had the Lord to say, "Nevertheless I have against thee, that thou hast left thy first <b>love</b>" ( Revelation 2:4 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#133:16">Page 133</a>   When our hearts are illuminated by His <b>love</b> we are in conscious suitability to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#134:5">Page 134</a>   Paul was conscious of a <b>love</b> which had divested him at its own cost of everything that was unsuited to itself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#134:7">Page 134</a>   He recognized nothing as life to God but CHRIST living in him; and the One who had thus set him free in the presence of divine <b>love</b> from all that attached to him as a man in the flesh was now the object of his heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#134:9">Page 134</a>   but I cannot improve my wretched self, and I cannot get rid of it", I should like you to consider the infinite <b>love</b> that is here brought before us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#134:10">Page 134</a>   The Son of God has undertaken in <b>love</b> to remove all my unsuitability, and to accomplish this He has given Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#134:16">Page 134</a>   It is a most blessed thing to know Him in His greatness and glory, and to know that there is an eternal link of <b>love</b> between Him and me -- <b>love</b> which has removed for its own satisfaction and at its own cost everything that I am morally as of the race of Adam, so that I might be free in the presence of that <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#135:1">Page 135</a>   The Holy Ghost would illuminate our hearts with the light of this <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#135:2">Page 135</a>   And with the light and warmth of this <b>love</b> pervading our hearts, the dim and worthless, though often cherished idols of the earth, would retire into the shade to which they properly belong, and heaven would become supremely attractive because of the One who is there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#135:3">Page 135</a>   We have not merely deliverance, but the personal <b>love</b> of a DELIVERER.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#135:5">Page 135</a>   Here we see a further unfolding of what His <b>love</b> has effected.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#135:11">Page 135</a>   The Holy Ghost would light up our hearts with the glory and <b>love</b> of this wondrous association with Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#135:13">Page 135</a>   Such is the <b>love</b> of Christ that He cannot be satisfied without our company.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#136:3">Page 136</a>   His <b>love</b> delights to share with us the joys of that blessed world where He has gone, and to make us familiar with the Father's presence -- in a word, to have us near Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#136:4">Page 136</a>  Now, beloved brethren, is the light of all this <b>love</b> shining brightly in our hearts?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#136:8">Page 136</a>   Many of us are familiar with these scriptures but I put it first to myself and then to everyone here, Is  the <b>love</b> of Christ  the present illumination and joy of your heart?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#136:10">Page 136</a>   It is the blessed work of the Holy Ghost to maintain the light of Christ's <b>love</b> in our hearts -- He would feed that flame of <b>love</b> in our souls -- but this will not be the case if we are wrapped in the slumber of earthly-mindedness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#137:1">Page 137</a>   Beloved brethren, have we no links that need to be severed, links with the world that hinder our spiritual progress, and grieve the Holy Ghost, and cause the light of divine <b>love</b> to burn dim in our hearts?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#137:7">Page 137</a>   This is first <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#138:6">Page 138</a>   In thus presenting Himself to our hearts does He not recall the untold grace in which He stooped so low that He might bring divine <b>love</b> into contact with all our sin and woe?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#139:1">Page 139</a>   For them He still wears -- and delights to wear -- His Name of saving <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#140:4">Page 140</a>  "I Jesus" carries our hearts back to the day of His humiliation, and fills them with thoughts of the <b>love</b> which stooped so low to win and secure us for Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#141:2">Page 141</a>   For such a heart the shadow of His rejection rests on everything  here , while every ray that shines from that Star is bright with divine <b>love</b> that attracts to its own circle everyone who truly knows it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#141:4">Page 141</a>    I have a Person, and the <b>love</b> of that Person for my heart .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac20.htm#141:5">Page 141</a>   And when I think WHO that Person is, and how He has brought divine <b>love</b> to me, and how He draws my heart to Himself in an ineffable scene of divine affections, I begin to taste divine satisfaction.<br>
<h3>Volume 21 - A Sure Foundation</h3>
<a href="../cac/cac21.htm#5:14">Page 5</a>   But what was due to us has come upon One who in perfect divine <b>love</b> was found in the place of sin and death.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#4:1">Page 4</a>  If this apprehension of His <b>love</b> is maintained in power it speedily leads to what I call the second step of affection.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#4:5">Page 4</a>   His lordship is not a measure of duty or responsibility alone; it is a claim acquired by <b>love</b> and gladly rendered by <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#4:7">Page 4</a>   I belong to Him, He has a right to me; and this not merely because of the righteous claim which redemption has given Him, but because of the <b>love</b> of His heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#4:8">Page 4</a>   He has paid the full price, but the <b>love</b> that paid is greater than the price.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#4:10">Page 4</a>   When this <b>love</b> is known it produces true devotedness, and maintains the heart in pure and holy liberty.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#73:3">Page 73</a>   With very much <b>love</b> in the Lord, Yours ever very affectionately, October 7th, 1917.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#73:10">Page 73</a>  It is far better to be exercised and disciplined under His hand, however humbling to us the process may be, that we may learn the grace, <b>love</b>, and faithfulness of God, than to be left to a smooth path in which our souls might never really rise above nature's level.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#73:14">Page 73</a>   It is the active interest of  <b>love</b> , and comes in to help us to run the race that lies before us.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#75:5">Page 75</a>  God carries out His purposes in the sovereignty of His mercy and <b>love</b>; if He did not do so, they would most certainly fail completely, man being what he is.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#75:11">Page 75</a>   But in view of purpose He works along moral lines, and on this line the obedience of faith comes in, self-judgment, watchfulness and prayer, purpose of heart to cleave to the Lord, faith in Christ Jesus and <b>love</b> to the saints, Christ as Object and Teacher, meekness and lowliness as learned of Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#76:4">Page 76</a>   The Spirit alone can maintain the right balance of the two in our thoughts and I am sure, as we go on, we learn to attach the true value to each, neither letting ourselves off easily by enfeebling the thought of responsibility, nor stopping short of that depth of holy self-judgment that casts us altogether upon sovereign mercy and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#76:5">Page 76</a>  With much <b>love</b> in the Lord, Your affectionate brother, 1918.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#76:6">Page 76</a>  ... I think amidst all the exercises of the present time one learns to value in a special way every movement of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#78:4">Page 78</a>   The <b>love</b> of God has opened up to us a way out, but it is by eating the flesh of the Son of man and drinking His blood.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#78:5">Page 78</a>   The fact that He has come into death for us shows the impossibility of connecting  life  with what we are naturally, but it is the blessed manifestation of divine <b>love</b> "come down" (words specially characteristic of this chapter) to the lowest point that in the appropriation of it we might live spiritually.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#78:7">Page 78</a>   We do not drink the blood in its atoning character -- that is exclusively for God, meeting His holy glory in every way as to sin -- but we drink it as the blessed witness of divine <b>love</b> that would come down into death so that there might be a way out for us from everything that we were naturally, and that we might appropriate the flesh and blood of the Son of man as the manifestation of a <b>love</b> which we could have known in no other way.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#79:9">Page 79</a>   I hope also to mention it on Monday to all present so that there may be united prayer, so that you may count upon it that your visits to Teignmouth have secured the affectionate interest in you of a few who <b>love</b> God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#80:16">Page 80</a>  With much <b>love</b> in the Lord, Yours very affectionately, January 9th, 1919.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#80:25">Page 80</a>   Still the Lord can deal with this in His own way of perfect faithfulness and <b>love</b>, and use all to establish what is of God in the souls of His saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#81:19">Page 81</a>  With very much <b>love</b> in the Lord, Yours very affectionately in Him, February 9th, 1919.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#84:3">Page 84</a>   The assembly has departed from first <b>love</b> and is in a fallen state; Christ and the Spirit have lost their place; and man's will and order (which is really confusion) are seen on every hand.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#84:6">Page 84</a>   There is a call to be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus, to be prepared for suffering, to strive diligently to present oneself approved to God, to shun profane vain babblings, to withdraw from iniquity, to separate from vessels to dishonour, to flee youthful lusts, and to pursue righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace with them that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#84:10">Page 84</a>   But the condition of the assembly -- the vessel of testimony -- is such that faithful individuals would be concerned rather as to spiritual healing -- that the saints should be found walking together according to truth, and in holy separation from the world, and from everything that is not according to the will of the Lord; that full place should be given to the Holy Spirit and His ministry of the glory of Christ; that the relations of Christ to the assembly and of the assembly to Christ should be known and entered into; that the members of the body of Christ should recognise their corporate bond with one another, and be found acting happily and healthfully in their mutual relations as such; that the joints of supply should be in such living contact with the Head as to minister of His fulness continually, so that the body may be united together and increase with the increase of God; that saints may hold the truth in <b>love</b>, and "grow up to him in all things who is the head, the Christ: from whom the whole body, fitted together, and connected by every joint of supply, according to the working in its measure of each one part, works for itself the increase of the body to its self-building up in <b>love</b>",  Ephesians 4:15 , 16<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#85:4">Page 85</a>  We are drawing near to the moment of apostasy, and we read of one to come "whose coming is according to the working of Satan in all power and signs and wonders of falsehood, and in all deceit of unrighteousness to them that perish, because they received not the <b>love</b> of the truth that they might be saved",  2 Thessalonians 2:9 , 10.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#87:2">Page 87</a>   I venture to believe that all these exercises, and the activities of sympathy and <b>love</b> in the saints called forth by his sickness, were a sweeter expression of the <b>love</b> and "bowels and compassions" of the Christ than any act of miraculous power by which he might have been instantly healed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#87:5">Page 87</a>   And surely the development and exercise of such affections as these, eternal in their nature, though called into activity by circumstances connected with conditions of weakness and time, is a greater triumph of divine <b>love</b> and power than restoring the sick ones to health.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#88:13">Page 88</a>  With <b>love</b> in the Lord Jesus, Yours affectionately in Him, May 30th, 1919.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#89:13">Page 89</a>  With <b>love</b> in the Lord Jesus, Yours affectionately in Him, July 31st, 1919.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#90:2">Page 90</a>   But it is just at this point that confidence in God and His known <b>love</b> strengthens the heart, and one perceives His great thought to have us partake of His holiness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#90:4">Page 90</a>  The more definitely we seek and cherish continuous nearness to the Lord, and the manifestation of Himself to our hearts, the more will His <b>love</b> be free to take its own way with us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#90:6">Page 90</a>   His <b>love</b>, and the Spirit given, are the sure pledge of this.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#90:7">Page 90</a>  With very much <b>love</b> in the Lord, Yours affectionately in Him, August 28th, 1919.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#93:17">Page 93</a>   We are to "pursue righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart" (2: 22).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#94:5">Page 94</a>   Righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace, are bound up with the practical recognition of our divine bond with all saints as members of one another in Christ's body, and as built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#94:7">Page 94</a>   This necessitates much individual exercise, for if I am not pursuing righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace, how shall I be able to discern others who are doing so in dependence upon, and desiring loyalty to, the Lord?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#98:8">Page 98</a>   I am sure that as saints walk according to  2 Timothy 2:22 , and come together responsive to the Lord's <b>love</b>, they will know what it is to be "in assembly", and to taste largely, through His marvellous grace, of assembly privilege.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#99:25">Page 99</a>   But I think we should conclude from Scripture that the work of the Spirit at the end would not be on the line of re-establishing the Corinthian order so much as bringing about personal attachment to Christ and <b>love</b> to the brethren, so that all that is vitally characteristic of the assembly should be found here.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#100:2">Page 100</a>   Not a restoration of assembly status, but a revival of Christ in the affections of His saints, leading to <b>love</b> of the brethren.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#103:1">Page 103</a>   If they felt happy to use literally the words of  1 Corinthians 5:13  it would not affect my <b>love</b> for them or my fellowship with them, because I trust that  in mind and spirit  my brethren feel, and desire to own, the ruin as much as I do.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#103:17">Page 103</a>   Those who do not agree with the way in which this exercise is sought to be expressed may surely in brotherly <b>love</b> respect the exercise and bear with it<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#105:10">Page 105</a>   But both good and evil are known in the divine nature, even as God knows them -- a nature which is abhorrent of evil, and all whose activities, the unceasing outcome of <b>love</b>, are only good.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#105:11">Page 105</a>  There is indeed the activity of <b>love</b> now, but it is in the sphere of responsibility, and therefore it must needs flow out of a good conscience.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#106:3">Page 106</a>  With much <b>love</b> in the Lord Jesus, Yours affectionately in Him, January 14th, 1920.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#106:7">Page 106</a>   My heart is moved to send you a few lines of <b>love</b> and sympathy.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#106:8">Page 106</a>   The illness and departure of your dear son is indeed a deep trial and exercise for you, and it has been our privilege to pray for you that the sympathy and succour and <b>love</b> of Christ may be realised in your heart in a very special way.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#106:10">Page 106</a>   But He brings near to you what He is Himself, and the light of that <b>love</b> in which He became dead that He might open up a scene for us where no death shadow is ever known.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#106:17">Page 106</a>   This is the excellent working of that <b>love</b> that knows how to make the eater yield meat and the strong sweetness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#106:18">Page 106</a>   And the One who can do such things is praying for you at God's right hand, and many of those who <b>love</b> God are praying for you in the Holy Ghost down here.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#107:1">Page 107</a>   I only desired to let you know that I, and others here, are thinking of you in <b>love</b> and sympathy and praying for you.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#108:19">Page 108</a>   And, secondly, in the spirit of grace and <b>love</b>, that the offender might be exercised, convicted, and fully restored<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#109:1">Page 109</a>   The "motive" in all that was done would be the obedience of faith working through <b>love</b> .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#109:4">Page 109</a>  My power is very small, but I would certainly earnestly desire to use it to the utmost to prevent disintegration, and to build saints up in Christ, that as formed in the divine nature they may be comforted and knit together in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#109:9">Page 109</a>  With very much <b>love</b> in the Lord Jesus, Yours very affectionately in Him, March 9th, 1920.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#111:2">Page 111</a>   But the support and confidence which the consciousness of this gives are known only to faith and <b>love</b>, and to the holy and priestly exercises of saints in private with God.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#113:17">Page 113</a>  I should suppose that it was intended to convey that the predominant suggestion in the Supper is the Lord's death as the witness of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#113:19">Page 113</a>   In instituting it the Lord had in view the making present to the affections of His own during His absence -- all that He had been as amongst them in the service of <b>love</b>, all that He was as devoted to them even to death<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#114:3">Page 114</a>   But the Lord would have it to be treasured as the full disclosure of all the <b>love</b> of His heart -- and His <b>love</b> is Himself -- and of all the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#114:4">Page 114</a>   But I think the fact that all this was expressed in  death  gives it a sacrificial character, and that this character is peculiarly touching to the hearts of those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#114:8">Page 114</a>   Then the ram of consecration would speak of Christ as giving Himself so that the consecrated company might be brought under the influence of His devoted <b>love</b>, and nourished in their affections on all that He is.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#121:11">Page 121</a>   But the sweetest of all is that these bodily weaknesses and sufferings become the occasion of our learning the tender sympathies and consideration of the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#191:1">Page 191</a>   He has, in the wisdom of His <b>love</b>, ordained that it should be so, and He knew best how to awaken response to Him in the hearts of His own.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#191:2">Page 191</a>   To thus respond to the <b>love</b> which instituted the Supper does not mean that we forget or ignore the precious scriptures which speak of His presence with His own.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#191:4">Page 191</a>   Namely, that He is calling us to remember Him in the place where He has died, and that in the emblems before us He is bringing most touching impressions of Himself and His <b>love</b> to bear upon our hearts -- impressions which, if yielded to, would put us all into heart-condition such as would attract Him to us according to  John 14:18 , and such as would liberate us for that spiritual sphere of privilege where He can sing as Head in the midst of His brethren, the assembly.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#193:5">Page 193</a>  Divine Persons were known to Themselves alone in the past eternity, known in mutual affections, for God is <b>love</b>, but known in a way that Persons in Deity alone could know each other.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#193:8">Page 193</a>   Scripture does not say that He created as Son, but  John 1 ,  Colossians 1 , and  Hebrews 1  make known to us that the One whom we know as the Word, and as the Son of the Father's <b>love</b>, the One in whom God has spoken Son-wise, was the Creator -- God of  Genesis 1 ,  Psalm 102:25 , and many other scriptures.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#193:21">Page 193</a>   Certainly none but One who was God in the most absolute sense could have taken that Name so as to bring to men the revelation of God in <b>love</b>, that, in result, holy myriads might be secured to be in the place and relationship of sons eternally<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#195:3">Page 195</a>   But He spoke of this to the Father in connection with the unfolding of those purposes of divine <b>love</b> which He had come into manhood to effectuate.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#195:8">Page 195</a>   His eternal personality was essential to this, but it was a glory that stood in relation to the purpose of divine <b>love</b> concerning men.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#195:14">Page 195</a>  With much <b>love</b> in the Lord Jesus, Yours affectionately in Him, March 5th, 1931.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#197:1">Page 197</a>  We only know divine Persons  as  and  when  revealed, and in relation to purposes of <b>love</b> formed before the foundation of the world.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#197:8">Page 197</a>   We recognise that essential Deity is altogether beyond creature ken, but in boundless <b>love</b> to the creature, and for His <b>love</b>'s own satisfaction, God has come into the light of revelation.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#197:13">Page 197</a>   But they have been disclosed to us, so far as it is possible, by the coming of One divine Person into manhood to be known by men as the Object of the Father's <b>love</b> in the relationship of Son, and as responding in Son's affections to the Father.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#197:15">Page 197</a>   To be with Him where He is, and to behold the glory given Him by the Father, is to get the nearest and fullest apprehension of the <b>love</b> that existed before the foundation of the world that it is possible for creatures to have.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#198:4">Page 198</a>   But I think we should also be prepared to admit that there are inscrutable depths in Deity which are wholly beyond creature apprehension, and which therefore do not have place in revelation, which must in the wisdom of divine <b>love</b> have regard to creature capacity.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#198:6">Page 198</a>   The result will be that the <b>love</b> and grace of the revelation which God has been pleased to make of Himself mediatorially in the Son will be greatly magnified before our hearts.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#199:9">Page 199</a>   It was a profound and blessed testimony of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#199:10">Page 199</a>  The whole point of the Lord's words is that He Himself was about to give expression, by the giving of His body and the pouring out of His blood, to the will and <b>love</b> of God.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#205:18">Page 205</a>   And she should encourage her heart to think of Christ as perfectly expressing the <b>love</b> of God to her, and as expressing, too, how she stands in divine favour through Him and in Him.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#343:23">Page 343</a>   And I do not feel out of things, for I am abundantly comforted by the <b>love</b> of the brethren, and kept in touch with all that is moving spiritually amongst them.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#344:1">Page 344</a>  It is very sweet to experience the activity of <b>love</b>, and it is specially touching when manifested by those to whom one is unknown by face.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#344:2">Page 344</a>   For it is then truly "<b>love</b> in the Spirit", as flowing entirely from the link which the grace of God has brought about in the affections of His beloved saints leading them to identify themselves with the work of the Lord in every part of the field of service.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#347:22">Page 347</a>   Such an expression of <b>love</b> is most refreshing, and I thank God for His grace upon His beloved saints which leads them to identify themselves so definitely and practically with the work of the ministry, and it is especially gracious that they should think affectionately of one who can do so little as I can in this blessed service of the Lord, but I am sure they think of the worthiness of the One served, and this is very acceptable to Him<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#348:1">Page 348</a>  Please give the dear brethren my warmest <b>love</b> in the Lord, and my hearty thanks for their bountiful gift.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#348:7">Page 348</a>   Nothing less than a divine Person in our hearts could make real to us the wondrous thoughts of infinite <b>love</b>, and as those thoughts are realised we enter upon the most profound satisfaction, for what we are brought into can only be measured by what the Beloved is, and we can only bow in worship before the Father as we take it in.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#349:18">Page 349</a>  BELOVED BROTHER, -- I thank you for your letter which comes laden with comfort in Christ, and consolation of <b>love</b>, and fellowship of the Spirit .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#349:21">Page 349</a>   I seem to be left here just to experience what <b>love</b> there is in the hearts of the saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#350:3">Page 350</a>   It was not that the Lord appointed them; it was a spontaneous action of <b>love</b> on their part, and it was very pleasurable to the Lord.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#350:8">Page 350</a>  With much <b>love</b> in the Lord, Yours affectionately in Him, August 9th, 1945.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#350:15">Page 350</a>   The saints are worthy of the best possible service, and one finds they value everything that makes much of Christ and the assembly, and of the Father's <b>love</b>, even if this is set forth in feeble measure, and in limited vessels.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#350:16">Page 350</a>  With very much <b>love</b> in the Lord, Yours affectionately in Him, August 13th, 1945.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#351:7">Page 351</a>   The new day dawned in full splendour in His resurrection, but it was by His own service of <b>love</b> as the risen One that its light shone into the hearts of His own.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#351:10">Page 351</a>   There can be no doubt that she loved Him, and He had said, "He that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will <b>love</b> him, and will manifest myself to him", chapter 14: 21.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#352:18">Page 352</a>   What marks the new company is <b>love</b> one to another, and this necessarily draws saints together.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#353:13">Page 353</a>   In the earlier part of the day His service of <b>love</b> had been rendered to one and another, meeting their individual state and exercise with a view, it seems to me, to their coming together as of His assembly in the evening.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#354:12">Page 354</a>   The assembly is composed of persons who cannot but be found together because they <b>love</b> the Son of God, and, as keeping His commandment <b>love</b> one another.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#356:3">Page 356</a>   I would encourage you to turn directly to Him in your times of special need, with confidence that His <b>love</b> is unchanged and unchangeable.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#357:6">Page 357</a>   His intercessory service of <b>love</b> takes account of everything, and we may be fully assured of this at all times.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#357:11">Page 357</a>  With <b>love</b> in the Lord Jesus, Yours affectionately in Him, ... My impression is that in the present state of things there are many matters which have to be left to individual exercise and conscience, and I think the holding of shares in companies is one of them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#359:12">Page 359</a>   You have not to commend yourself to Him in any way; He commends His <b>love</b> to you in that while you are a sinner Christ died for you.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#363:9">Page 363</a>   He regards it as one body on earth, gifts being bestowed with a view to its edifying, that it may work for itself the increase of the body to its self-building up in <b>love</b>,  Ephesians 4 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#367:2">Page 367</a>  If such a one had gone to Philadelphia it seems to me very probable that the brethren would have said something like this to him: "Dear brother, we are deeply interested in you, as being of the assembly in Thyatira, for we <b>love</b> the brethren everywhere, and we feel a special care for those who are comparatively near to us, as you are.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#368:3">Page 368</a>   It has given us the sweetest sense of His <b>love</b> and concern, not only for the assembly universally, but for His saints in each local assembly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#373:11">Page 373</a>   It is not a law that we have before us, but a Person in whom all the light of God shines and whose <b>love</b> holds our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#375:7">Page 375</a>   It is then we experience in a very special way the refreshing power of His own <b>love</b> borne witness of in death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#375:10">Page 375</a>  And, if we learn how His <b>love</b> serves His own, that becomes the pattern and key-note of all our service towards one another.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#375:17">Page 375</a>   But in reality it is the positive and delightful service of the <b>love</b> of Christ -- whether in Himself or in His own -- in view of the saints entering into full assembly privilege<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#377:7">Page 377</a>   Then it is  with God  that we learn His  <b>love</b> , His unmeasured  grace , His glorious  purposes , His great thoughts concerning Christ and the assembly, the reality of the Spirit's power, and many other things which are accepted in theory by many but known as realities by few.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#378:6">Page 378</a>   Whether it be the terror of the Lord, the <b>love</b> of God, the value of Christ's work, or the blessings which faith enjoys, we must ourselves have entered into that which we press upon others or we become  lecturers  rather than  witnesses .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#380:9">Page 380</a>   It is a very holy and blessed moment for our hearts when we are chastened and subdued by a sorrow in which the <b>love</b> of Christ moves Him to participate.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#380:12">Page 380</a>  Mary, in  John 11 , knew what it was to have Him  with her  in the sorrow of death, and she made such acquaintance with Him in the hour of her sorrow that in result she was with Him  as to His  death  when no other heart entered into what lay in the path of His <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#383:1">Page 383</a>   And one very distinct form which His consideration for us has taken is that He has been pleased to tell us what the blessedness of the departed is, while they await the full and final triumph of divine <b>love</b> and power which will invest them with spiritual and glorious bodies like the body of Him who sits as a risen and glorified Man at God's right hand.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#383:5">Page 383</a>   That is, to be brought to taste and know in a deeper and fuller way what the Lord Jesus Christ is; and to know that we, and all His saints, are for ever bound up with Him, to possess and enjoy  through  Him and  in  Him and  with  Him the precious fruit of the <b>love</b> and victory of God!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#384:15">Page 384</a>   The One who told of the great supper of grace, and of the blessed invitings and compellings of divine <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#387:9">Page 387</a>   What far-reaching authority, exercised in the beneficent activity of divine goodness and <b>love</b>, lies in that title -- the Lord!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#387:19">Page 387</a>   He holds them even in death in the power of redemption, in the power of the <b>love</b> in which He gave Himself for them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#387:24">Page 387</a>   Henceforth no other power but His will ever touch them, and that power is the servant of a well-known <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#387:27">Page 387</a>  We can understand Paul's desire to be with Christ, for we know what a sense he had of the <b>love</b> of Christ, and of the unsearchable riches of Christ<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#391:2">Page 391</a>   Then will the Son of God receive us to Himself, and set us with Him in His own place in His Father's house, conformed to His image in bodily condition that He may be the Firstborn among many brethren, all set eternally in the glory and affections and condition of sonship for the satisfaction of the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#392:4">Page 392</a>   I trust your dear sister will be comforted as she thinks of the <b>love</b> and wisdom of God who has taken her child away from all the evil of this world, and from all that might have developed in his own heart, to be safely housed in His eternal abode, beyond the reach of evil for evermore.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#392:5">Page 392</a>  With <b>love</b> in the Lord Jesus, Yours sincerely in Him, ... There are those and possibly many who read  Ephesians 2  as being purely objective, that is, something wrought in Christ altogether aside and apart from the persons to whom the apostle was writing.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#393:3">Page 393</a>   How far God in the power of His sovereign <b>love</b> has really brought it to pass as a spiritual reality is another matter, and one as to which there is room for much exercise and prayer.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#394:5">Page 394</a>   "Our God whom we have known,  Well known in Jesu's <b>love</b>,  Rests in the blessing of His own,  Before Himself above".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#394:7">Page 394</a>   It is not the abode of God's holiness in the midst of an evil world, but it is the sanctuary where He is known and approached in the circle of His own <b>love</b>, and of all the infinitely blessed thoughts to which that <b>love</b> has given birth.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#398:2">Page 398</a>  The light of glory shineth  At God's right hand above,  His righteousness and mercy,  The sunshine of His <b>love</b>;  For Jesus now is crowned  In holy splendour there,  And God is seen effulgent  In Him so bright and fair.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#399:2">Page 399</a>    The <b>love</b> of God pervadeth  With life and bliss supreme,  And warmth of deep affection,  That holy, happy scene.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac22.htm#399:3">Page 399</a>    There all is of the Father,  The outcome of His <b>love</b>;  Wrought by His Son and Spirit  Are all the things above.<br>
<h3>Volume 23 - An Outline of the Epistle to the Hebrews</h3>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#2:19">Page 2</a>   So today the covenant comes in in connection with what is the cherished delight of God's heart; He has one Object before Him to fill His heart with satisfaction, and in which His <b>love</b> has found full delight; that is the thought in the Son.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#3:21">Page 3</a>   That is, the blessedness of God known in <b>love</b> and in conscious relationship is before the soul.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#4:2">Page 4</a>  God is speaking in Son, so the speaking comes from the centre of God's delight and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#5:5">Page 5</a>   As sons we should be greatly interested in the inheritance; we should be interested in what <b>love</b> has assigned to us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#5:9">Page 5</a>   The thought of the Son being introduced as Heir of all things shews what a character the blessed God is going to give to the universe; He introduces the greatest thoughts of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#13:12">Page 13</a>   Death came in by sin, but something else came in by the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#18:15">Page 18</a>   What we have to see is that the Lord in His <b>love</b> is qualified by obedience and suffering to take us by the hand and lead us past every temptation and difficulty.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#20:9">Page 20</a>   That is another thing, a positive stream of <b>love</b> acting in saints generally.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#28:27">Page 28</a>   That enables us to <b>love</b> all the saints; we get on to the Colossian and Ephesian platform; we <b>love</b> even people we do not know because we take account of them according to Christ Jesus.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#42:2">Page 42</a>   The Mediator is entirely on God's part; it is through His death that Christ has become the Mediator, the One by whom the thoughts of God's <b>love</b> have been made good.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#43:13">Page 43</a>   Two things are brought out commensurate with one another, the <b>love</b> of God and the death of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#43:15">Page 43</a>   God's <b>love</b> is expressed in that death never to be so expressed again.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#44:28">Page 44</a>   A man of the world would say, 'There are people who were once like me, seeking satisfaction from things here, but now they are supremely happy in the <b>love</b> of God; they do not want the world at all.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#46:22">Page 46</a>   If there is no response it shews we have not come into the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#46:23">Page 46</a>   How could a creature know the <b>love</b> of God and not respond?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#53:21">Page 53</a>   said, 'God puts you between His <b>love</b> on the one side and the work of the Spirit on the other.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#56:3">Page 56</a>   We may depend upon it that divine <b>love</b> will serve us in our necessities, circumstantial and moral, but if He appears before the face of God for us, He appears in glory and beauty.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#57:10">Page 57</a>   Nothing is more blessed than the will of God, the will of supreme <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#57:21">Page 57</a>   All this is the witness to His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#57:22">Page 57</a>   You are not going to have anything better in heaven than the <b>love</b> of God<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#58:1">Page 58</a>   I do not expect to have anything greater to fill my soul with rapture than the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#58:2">Page 58</a>   The Holy Spirit is pouring the <b>love</b> of God into hearts now; that is heaven; there will not be anything better in heaven than that.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#58:4">Page 58</a>  Those are the two great realities; it needed them both in order that we might know the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#58:21">Page 58</a>   The knowledge of that <b>love</b> must produce response?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#60:38">Page 60</a>   A new way that is paved with <b>love</b>, His flesh makes it possible.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#67:3">Page 67</a>   If you see the <b>love</b> of God in the opening up of the way you want to go in, and that raises the question of state.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#67:12">Page 67</a>   Everything that is objective in a divine Person is attractive to those who <b>love</b> God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#67:13">Page 67</a>   A "true heart" means that we <b>love</b> God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#68:12">Page 68</a>   He is there in the full intelligence of the purpose and <b>love</b> of God in regard of the sanctified.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#70:16">Page 70</a>   If people are converted to God they <b>love</b> God and would like to have as much to do with God as possible.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#77:13">Page 77</a>   We would be saturated with thoughts of divine <b>love</b>; we would come out to the service of the altar  --  to what is public  --  and what a power there would be for the service of the altar.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#80:22">Page 80</a>   Would the <b>love</b> of God within the veil affect us in coming out?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#82:21">Page 82</a>   It will produce exercise  --  <b>love</b> and faith and exercise and prayer before God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#84:17">Page 84</a>  ' Nothing pleases the Lord better than to see us drawn together in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#85:19">Page 85</a>   In the earlier days it pleases God that there should be freshness and reality so that there is something there that God can appeal to, as He said to Israel, "I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the <b>love</b> of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land not sown",  Jeremiah 2:2 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#87:8">Page 87</a>   That is the subjective side: <b>love</b> to God's name as manifested towards His people; that is all on the line of purpose.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#89:27">Page 89</a>   What a dreadful thing to  <b>love</b>  that world!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#94:13">Page 94</a>   We have all been accustomed to say that God's purpose is for the satisfaction of His <b>love</b>, but what gives God satisfaction is that His purpose is proportioned to the sufferings and death of His beloved Son.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#110:7">Page 110</a>   We have no title to anything except the sovereign title <b>love</b> gives.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#112:15">Page 112</a>   If we had more <b>love</b> we should more desire to be beneficial to the saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#130:19">Page 130</a>   So He always conducts Himself in the way of <b>love</b>; even if He is severe it is in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#142:7">Page 142</a>   How He loves to be thought of as a Man, yet near enough to God for God to communicate to and through Him all the great thoughts of His <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#155:14">Page 155</a>  What sets the apostle praying in Colossians and Ephesians is that he has heard of their faith in Christ Jesus and <b>love</b> to all the saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#158:1">Page 158</a>   In that circle there is no room for our needs  --  it is a circle of <b>love</b> where the Father's name is made known.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#159:7">Page 159</a>   It carries us into the circle of the <b>love</b> of the Father.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#159:8">Page 159</a>   "That the <b>love</b> with which thou hast loved me may be in them".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#159:10">Page 159</a>  Can we really say that by the blessed ministry of the Son we know something of what it is to have that <b>love</b> that rests on Him in our hearts?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#159:24">Page 159</a>   The response to <b>love</b> that He has made known.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#159:25">Page 159</a>   It is the natural response to the knowledge of the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#159:26">Page 159</a>   How much have our hearts known of that expanse of <b>love</b>?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#160:2">Page 160</a>   And where is the song, the response to the wonderful <b>love</b> that He has made known?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#160:3">Page 160</a>   I believe every bit of response to the knowledge of the Father's <b>love</b> reaches Him by the voice of the Son.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#162:31">Page 162</a>   He visits Man as the Object of His delight and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#165:7">Page 165</a>   It is in this way that "all things work together for good to those who <b>love</b> God, to those who are called according to purpose"; everything works along the line of effecting conformity to the image of His Son.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#167:11">Page 167</a>   What marks the assembly is that it is in the full light of the <b>love</b> of God, for His name has been declared by Him who said, "Go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#168:5">Page 168</a>  In Israel obedience and piety and <b>love</b> had place at home and all the year round, but when they took up their relations with God according to the full privilege of their calling it was in the place where He set His name.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#168:6">Page 168</a>   We are always to be marked by obedience, piety and <b>love</b> but to take up the full privilege of our calling we must be together.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#169:9">Page 169</a>   There never was a greater sign and wonder than was seen on the day of Pentecost and the days that followed  --  a great company in which not one person was thinking of himself, all acting in <b>love</b> one to another, all acting and speaking and thinking in the spirit of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#170:7">Page 170</a>  Then He has also brought us to know God as revealed in <b>love</b> through His death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#171:5">Page 171</a>   I should like every christian to consider how Christ knew the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#171:7">Page 171</a>   Israel will know the <b>love</b> of God in millennial conditions; there will be neither adversary nor evil occurrent; they will be surrounded by a scene of perfect peace and joy.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#171:8">Page 171</a>   But Christ knew the <b>love</b> of God in sorrow and suffering, and we know the <b>love</b> of God in the midst of a scene of desolation and sorrow --  a scene that is darkened for our hearts by its rejection of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#171:9">Page 171</a>   The conditions here are those of tribulation and grief, but in the presence of these things we taste the <b>love</b> of God in a sweetness that surpasses what will be known in millennial blessedness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#172:7">Page 172</a>   He has been glorified in death, and a company has been sanctified by being brought to participate in the fruit of Christ's body being given for them and of the <b>love</b> of God as revealed through death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#172:8">Page 172</a>   It is to a sanctified company that the Father's name can be made known  --  a company that was in the Father's purpose, the fruit of sovereign <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#172:10">Page 172</a>  The declaration of the Father's name has been made so that the <b>love</b> which rests on Christ the Head may be in the saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#172:11">Page 172</a>   This is something more than the <b>love</b> of God to men in new covenant character, a <b>love</b> that took account of all that man was, and met it all through death, and brought out what God is in relation to it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#172:12">Page 172</a>   But  this  is a <b>love</b> of complacency  --  the <b>love</b> that rested upon the Son in manhood.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#172:13">Page 172</a>   The declaration of the Father's name involves the making known the relationship that subsisted between Himself and the Son in manhood  --  the making known of the <b>love</b> which belonged to that relationship.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#172:15">Page 172</a>   "I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known; that the <b>love</b> with which thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them",  John 17:26 <br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#173:1">Page 173</a>   That <b>love</b> was not only to be known objectively, but was to be  in the saints , their consciously known and enjoyed portion.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#173:6">Page 173</a>   Have our hearts ever been thrilled with that song  --  His own response to the <b>love</b> of complacency and relationship in which He is with the Father?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#175:4">Page 175</a>   The spirit of Christ, the grace of Christ, the meekness and gentleness of Christ, His faithfulness, His obedience, His <b>love</b>  --  what signs and wonders are these!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#188:8">Page 188</a>   He speaks of the "way" as if it were paved with divine <b>love</b>, "the new and living way".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#188:9">Page 188</a>   It is the declaration of God in <b>love</b> by His blessed Son, and that way, paved with <b>love</b>, is the way in which we can move into the greatness and nearness of God, leaving behind everything that is imperfect, all that is connected with the flesh, and find ourselves in a region where the dominant thing is that of the great Priest over the house of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#193:7">Page 193</a>   In His <b>love</b> He has made a certain disposition of things and has assigned to us a heavenly inheritance.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#193:12">Page 193</a>   This is very important because it is the way by which we know God in the present thoughts of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#193:13">Page 193</a>   We know God as being instructed in the heavenly purpose which His blessed <b>love</b> has formed and for which He has secured us through the death of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#193:14">Page 193</a>   The strength of His <b>love</b> has been testified in the death of Christ, but the inheritance which it has secured for us is a heavenly one.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#196:16">Page 196</a>   That is the thought of the <b>love</b> of God, and the death of Christ has made the divine thought irreversible.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#209:7">Page 209</a>   Thus succoured and encouraged it is our privilege to be at rest in the goodness and <b>love</b> of God, so as not to be diverted from the joy of our heavenly calling by anxious care about circumstances here.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#210:3">Page 210</a>   And as the <b>love</b> of the Father is in us we shall not <b>love</b> the world or its things.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#216:6">Page 216</a>   This brings us at once to the full height of the heavenly calling, and unfolds in all its blessedness the purpose of God's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#216:9">Page 216</a>   To bring this to pass the Fulness of the Godhead has been pleased to dwell in the Son of the Father's <b>love</b>, by Him to reconcile all things to Itself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#216:14">Page 216</a>   Has He any company in a special way for the satisfaction of His own <b>love</b>?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#217:2">Page 217</a>   God will have many sons brought to glory  --  to be with and like His beloved Son  --  for the satisfaction of His own <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#219:6">Page 219</a>   We are brought in view of the purpose of His <b>love</b>, according to which He is bringing many sons to glory.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#219:10">Page 219</a>   If we apprehend the purpose of His <b>love</b>, and the wonderful place Christ has in relation to His rest, and all the infinite goodness that finds its yea and amen in Christ, the effect must be that the presence of God becomes the most attractive spot in the universe to our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#220:1">Page 220</a>   It is in Him that we apprehend our heavenly calling and the purpose of God's <b>love</b>, for He is the Firstborn among those who are being brought as many sons to glory.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#220:10">Page 220</a>   "God commends his <b>love</b> to us, in that, we being still sinners, Christ has died for us",  Romans 5:8 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#220:11">Page 220</a>   In the death of Christ two things are plainly set forth  --  that God has brought in remission of sins for man, and that He has made Himself known as acting in perfect <b>love</b> and grace towards man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#222:12">Page 222</a>   The grace of the Priest comes down to us that we may be knit together in <b>love</b>, and that we may find in the company of our brethren a circle where there is salvation from the evil influences of the world.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#222:13">Page 222</a>   There is a circle here where holy <b>love</b> can be found; there are "holy brethren" here, and as we <b>love</b> them and cleave to them we find security and preservation from the contaminating influences which rule in the world.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#223:3">Page 223</a>   Our first thought should be, Do they know and <b>love</b> the Lord, and are they evidently seeking to walk in the truth?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#223:5">Page 223</a>   If we <b>love</b> the "holy brethren" because they are "holy brethren", we shall find, in cleaving to them, present salvation from "the corruption that is in the world through lust".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#223:7">Page 223</a>   The saints are exhorted to remember those who had spoken to them the word of God, and to "consider one another for provoking to <b>love</b> and good works; not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom is with some; but encouraging one another, and by so much the more as ye see the day drawing near",  Hebrews 10:24 , 25.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#223:8">Page 223</a>  It is by the ministry of the word, and by knitting our hearts together in <b>love</b>, that Christ would deliver us from the contaminating influences of the world.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#224:12">Page 224</a>   It is He who can present the blessedness of God to our hearts, and can order our souls in the knowledge of those holy things in which the <b>love</b> of God will find its eternal satisfaction, so that in result we may be constituted worshippers in the Father's presence.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#225:5">Page 225</a>   We must appropriate the death of Christ as that which frees us in spirit from that which we are, so that we may enter into what God is, and into the purposes of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#225:8">Page 225</a>   He has come out in the blessedness of His nature, and in the glory of His attributes, to make known His holy <b>love</b>, and this by the death of Jesus.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#225:12">Page 225</a>   In the very place where we were removed in holy judgment God was revealed in holy <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#225:13">Page 225</a>   The death of Christ is the blessed witness that God is <b>love</b>, and thus it becomes a new and living way by which we can enter into holy things.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#225:15">Page 225</a>   The house of God is where God dwells in all the blessedness of His holy <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#225:17">Page 225</a>   All the blessedness of the place where God dwells is under the administration of the One whose <b>love</b> we know so well in that He went into death to make God known to our hearts<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#226:5">Page 226</a>   Many a saint is convinced that the way is open for him to draw near, whose heart is not sufficiently under the mighty attraction of divine <b>love</b> to approach.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#226:6">Page 226</a>   We need "a true heart", that is a heart that has come under the attraction of divine <b>love</b>, and is responsive to that <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#234:12">Page 234</a>   We find they were marked by three wonderful things, the work of faith, labour of <b>love</b> and constancy of hope.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#235:16">Page 235</a>  Then the saints come into view in the "labour of <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#235:17">Page 235</a>   <b>Love</b> keeps us right with one another, and labour is needed for that; saints cannot go on together without exercise, so there is the labour of <b>love</b>, and as to outlook, there is nothing but the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ; that is kept constantly in view, the "enduring constancy of hope"<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#236:2">Page 236</a>   The "work of faith", that is, everything is done on the principle that it is God's will; then the active service of <b>love</b> among the saints which keeps us right with one another; and lastly the outlook, no other prospect is to be present to the saints but the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#236:9">Page 236</a>   The apostle Paul's teaching was a labour of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#236:18">Page 236</a>   They saw the gospel in Paul's life; they saw the <b>love</b> of God and the grace of Christ in a man, and the power of the preaching was connected with the character of the man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#242:22">Page 242</a>   There is nothing so bold as <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#244:10">Page 244</a>   One can see more and more the importance of Paul's pressing on saints to <b>love</b> one another.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#244:11">Page 244</a>   John brings it out too, not doctrine but life, and that is the activity of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#244:14">Page 244</a>   It is the same grace as was seen in the Lord when He would have gathered His people under the warmth and protection of His wing; that was like this word "cherish"; the apostle in his <b>love</b> cherished these young converts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#244:15">Page 244</a>   There is such beautiful freshness about this first epistle of Paul's; it throbs and palpitates with life, and with all the activity of divine <b>love</b>; we see the activity of early <b>love</b> here<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#245:3">Page 245</a>   There was a wonderful presentation of divine <b>love</b> in the preaching and in the preacher.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#245:10">Page 245</a>   Nothing can stop this <b>love</b> if it is there, no outside influence; so nothing can stop one from desiring the good of another, however bad they are or however they may have treated one.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#245:11">Page 245</a>  Then there was not only this yearning of <b>love</b>, but such a beautiful life of blameless purity had been exhibited among them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#247:12">Page 247</a>   If the Lord lets us go through a time of unprecedented sorrow and trial it is to draw us together in <b>love</b>, so that affections may be in activity.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#249:2">Page 249</a>   ( Hymn 160 ) The last two verses of chapter 2 are so beautiful; they suggest to me first <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#249:9">Page 249</a>   Paul was so imbued with the <b>love</b> of Christ that his joy too was to have the saints, particularly his own converts, there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#250:1">Page 250</a>   Paul never departed from first <b>love</b>, he maintained it to the finish.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#250:2">Page 250</a>   Neither Paul nor John nor Peter ever left first <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#250:7">Page 250</a>   Yes, the Lord entered on a path of service of <b>love</b> and went through with it absolutely.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#250:10">Page 250</a>  The apostles were not a reflection merely of this <b>love</b>, but were filled with the same <b>love</b> as was in the heart of the Lord; it never failed, and they went right through, jealously caring for the good of the saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#252:7">Page 252</a>   It is beautiful; first <b>love</b> had not declined in them any more than it had in Paul.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#252:8">Page 252</a>   I like to think of the church in its first <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#252:9">Page 252</a>   We must not lose sight of the fact that the church did stand once in first <b>love</b>, though the Lord had after to say, "Thou hast left thy first <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#252:18">Page 252</a>   First <b>love</b> means first in quality, not in time.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#252:19">Page 252</a>   Some of us might never have reached first <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#252:20">Page 252</a>   It is a peculiar character of <b>love</b> that marked the saints at Ephesus at a certain time.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#252:21">Page 252</a>   First <b>love</b> is that we should <b>love</b> one another as Christ loved us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#252:22">Page 252</a>   "<b>Love</b> one another, as I have loved you",  John 15:12 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#252:29">Page 252</a>   If we are not settled in faith we cannot go on to <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#252:36">Page 252</a>   Then you get a sense that He loves His saints, for if He loves me He loves all, and you think of the saints as the subjects of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#252:37">Page 252</a>   If Christ loves the saints, and I am affected by His <b>love</b>, I must <b>love</b> them too.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#253:15">Page 253</a>   <b>Love</b> goes out to all.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#253:28">Page 253</a>   <b>Love</b> is the way of holiness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#253:29">Page 253</a>   Paul speaks of their exceeding and abounding "in <b>love</b> toward one another .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#254:4">Page 254</a>   The abounding of <b>love</b> is the way to it, so holiness is a moral continuation; it is not that the coming of the Lord brings in new elements.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#254:5">Page 254</a>   Christians like to think of being in glory as the fruit of redemption and divine grace and <b>love</b>, as though there was no moral preparation on their part, but God's idea is to have a people morally suited for translation, so that it is in accord with all God's principles to take them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#254:11">Page 254</a>   So here, if there is a people exceeding and abounding in <b>love</b> toward one another, it is not a very wonderful thing if they go into heaven without dying, and come out of heaven with the Lord.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#254:13">Page 254</a>   You cannot find anything like it in the world; people are kind and benevolent and do many things for each other, but there is nothing like divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#254:14">Page 254</a>   How much we need to pray, "The Lord make [you] to exceed and abound in <b>love</b> toward one another" (verse 12).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#254:16">Page 254</a>   There is something exquisitely sensitive in divine <b>love</b>, and that is why it promotes holiness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#254:17">Page 254</a>   Legality feels a spot because it is a reproach on  me , but <b>love</b> feels it because it is a reproach on those Christ loves, and on Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#254:18">Page 254</a>   Nothing is so sanctifying as <b>love</b>, so you get a wonderful standard of holiness if <b>love</b> is in activity; it is the divine nature, God's nature is holy <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#255:3">Page 255</a>   <b>Love</b> is repellent of all evil, nothing is so repellent of evil as that intense yearning for the good of another.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#255:5">Page 255</a>   The principle of lust is something for  self , but the principle of <b>love</b> is the good of another.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#255:6">Page 255</a>   If we are in the activity of <b>love</b>, every kind of unholy movement is put in the place of death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#255:12">Page 255</a>   There seems to be suggested here that there is a result for God in their exceeding and abounding in <b>love</b>; it is in order to their being "unblamable in holiness before our God and Father".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#255:13">Page 255</a>   It is the Lord who effects the result; it is the Lord effecting the pleasure of God, and the way He does it is by making His saints exceed and abound in <b>love</b>, and that leads to their being unblamable in holiness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#255:16">Page 255</a>   We get the affection of Paul for the saints; he delights in them, and Christ delights in them, and the climax is that through the exercise of <b>love</b> on the part of Paul, and on the part of the Lord, they are brought into perfect suitability to God and the Father.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#256:2">Page 256</a>   We know that the saints will be translated as the fruit of redemption and of God's blessed purposes of <b>love</b>, but there is a moral suitability for translation also, and that comes out in this epistle.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#256:3">Page 256</a>   It is as saints walk in holiness and <b>love</b> that they are suitable for translation.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#257:21">Page 257</a>   It is a question of <b>love</b> coming into activity and leading to holiness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#257:22">Page 257</a>   As we walk in <b>love</b> we become more sensitive to things.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#257:23">Page 257</a>   Nothing is so sensitive as <b>love</b>; it is the divine nature.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#259:3">Page 259</a>   There is the principle of obedience (verse 2) as well as <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#259:6">Page 259</a>   There are moral obligations on one side, and the activity of <b>love</b> on the other.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#259:7">Page 259</a>   Scripture never weakens the side of moral obligation, and Scripture maintains the activity of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#259:8">Page 259</a>   We are taught to <b>love</b>, and if I <b>love</b> my brother I shall not wrong him, but Scripture does not leave it there; it insists on the moral obligation as well.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#259:11">Page 259</a>   Where does failure come in, with lack of obedience or with lack of <b>love</b>?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#259:21">Page 259</a>  ' When it comes to brotherly <b>love</b> (verse 9) the apostle says, "Ye yourselves are taught of God".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#259:25">Page 259</a>   These young converts were in the freshness of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#260:1">Page 260</a>   They should be a perfect reservoir of divine affections; they should provoke one another to <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#260:16">Page 260</a>   That is divine <b>love</b>, when you feel His arms round you, and His kiss, and the beating of His heart --  and then you are taught to <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#260:18">Page 260</a>   We find in John's epistles that we have a teaching unction; the Spirit teaches us; there is an inward working, the activity of God in the soul; so we are not only kept in the right way by external things, but there is an inward movement in the soul  --  "they shall know me"  --  and the result is they <b>love</b> one another<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#261:2">Page 261</a>   A people walking in holiness and <b>love</b> are nearly out of the world and are ready for the rapture.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#261:3">Page 261</a>  We <b>love</b> saints because we see in them what is of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#261:7">Page 261</a>   Why is it brotherly <b>love</b> here?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#261:10">Page 261</a>   I suppose it is thinking of <b>love</b> in its practical manifestation in a company of people who are down here as brethren.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#262:12">Page 262</a>   We have been seeing what an immense place the activity of <b>love</b> had amongst these brethren; loving one another was the way of holiness and so on.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#262:13">Page 262</a>   Paul had charged them to <b>love</b> one another, and said they did it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#262:14">Page 262</a>   It was their <b>love</b> for one another that made them so sorrowful when some of their number slept.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#264:12">Page 264</a>   My impression is that the great preparation for the Lord's coming is that we should <b>love</b> one another.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#270:9">Page 270</a>   We ought to want to see the Lord because we <b>love</b> Him, but there is another side  --  'O Jesus, precious Saviour,  O when wilt Thou return?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#271:23">Page 271</a>   There must be the actual wearing of the breastplate of faith and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#271:24">Page 271</a>   We are protected by being in the positive good of faith and <b>love</b>, faith holding the soul in abiding relation with God, and <b>love</b> maintaining an active interest in the saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#272:1">Page 272</a>   Faith keeps God ever in the view of the soul, and <b>love</b> puts us right with our brethren.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#272:5">Page 272</a>   God disciplines His people, but it is in <b>love</b>, never in wrath.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#277:7">Page 277</a>   Verse 3 tells us, "Remembering unceasingly your work of faith, and labour of <b>love</b>, and enduring constancy of hope, of our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#277:8">Page 277</a>   Faith, <b>love</b> and hope are our spiritual faculties and the Thessalonians did not seek to exercise their natural senses in these things.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#277:12">Page 277</a>  This epistle may be divided into three parts, namely: The work of faith, to chapter 3 verse 10 The labour of <b>love</b>, to chapter 4 verse 10 The constancy of hope, to chapter 5 verse 2 I desire to speak a little on each of these points and trust all will be interested because, if believers, we all have them in some degree.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#280:1">Page 280</a>   Let us remember that the pilgrim life is before God, so that we may walk with God in the life of privilege until the Lord descends and we are translated and set down for ever in the presence of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#280:3">Page 280</a>  Secondly we come to the "labour of <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#280:4">Page 280</a>   The work of faith puts us right in relation to God and the labour of <b>love</b> puts us right in regard of our brethren, for it leads in the direction of holiness and thus tends to unity.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#280:6">Page 280</a>   As we have seen, the work of faith comes before the labour of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#280:9">Page 280</a>   In  John 17  we hear the voice of divine <b>love</b> and the burden of the chapter is that the saints may be kept from evil and sanctified through the truth in view of unity, "that they may be all one".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#280:10">Page 280</a>   The labour of <b>love</b> is to be on this line; we should be labouring in order to promote holiness with a view to unity.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#280:12">Page 280</a>   We cannot be too sensitive as to this --  just as a bit of grit in the eye hinders the normal action of the whole organ until it is removed, so we should be so walking in holiness and self-judgment that all should be set aside in us that hinders the flow of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#280:15">Page 280</a>   We should be so in the energy of divine <b>love</b> that everything should go that is not of Christ or of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#281:11">Page 281</a>   This chapter sets forth the labour of <b>love</b>, and it is not an altogether easy thing; you must give your mind to it "with all" (not some) "lowliness and meekness".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#281:13">Page 281</a>   Then comes the outward thing, "bearing with one another in <b>love</b>; using diligence" (that is labouring) "to keep the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace" ( Ephesians 4:2 , 3) and that with every saint in this world, no less a circle.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#281:15">Page 281</a>   We find the blessed Lord is labouring to this end ( Ephesians 5:25 ), first in the <b>love</b> that gave Himself for the church, then working for the sanctification of it, and then comes the result, unity, one united company, no discord.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#281:16">Page 281</a>  Beloved friends, are we working in this direction to promote the <b>love</b> of Christ in the company?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#281:21">Page 281</a>   If our labour of <b>love</b> is to be effective we must be more and more in the company of Christ so as to come out in His spirit and character and thus help the whole church.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#281:24">Page 281</a>   Yes; through the ministry and expression of Christ, and this is the labour of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#282:1">Page 282</a>   If we are right with God through the work of faith and with our brethren through the labour of <b>love</b> we are morally prepared and free to look up in the "constancy of hope", because we know what God has treasured up in Christ, the joy and blessing He has up there, ready to burst forth and illuminate the entire universe.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#282:7">Page 282</a>   Is the <b>love</b> of God entering the heart?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#282:20">Page 282</a>   Oh, what a wonderful place we are put in if by the work of faith we are walking before God and with God, and by the labour of <b>love</b> seeking to walk in unity with our brethren and in the good of the constancy of hope, which would ever keep before us the One who is coming and all that is going to break forth in blessing through Him<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#287:17">Page 287</a>   It is faith and <b>love</b> that increase.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#289:15">Page 289</a>   The apostle says, "Your faith increases exceedingly, and the <b>love</b> of each one of you all towards one another abounds".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#289:16">Page 289</a>   That was Christ in the saints; the increase of faith and the abounding of <b>love</b> is Christ increasing in the saints by the blessed work of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#289:21">Page 289</a>   The work of God will all be there  --  faith, <b>love</b>, and all the blessed qualities of Christ, which are being wrought in the saints now.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#291:23">Page 291</a>   The saint walking in holiness and <b>love</b> down here is qualified to sit down 'in holiness bright' with the Lord.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#296:27">Page 296</a>   If the Day-star has arisen in my heart, I do not need to see the Jews going back to their land; I know the One who loves me is coming for me because He loves me, and I want Him because I <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#301:6">Page 301</a>   The difficulty with those that perish seems that they did not receive the <b>love</b> of the truth (verse 10).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#304:8">Page 304</a>   It is the abiding sense of divine <b>love</b> and grace that we need more than anything else.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#305:28">Page 305</a>   We are powerless in ourselves to think of the <b>love</b> of God  --  the Lord directs us (verse 5).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#305:31">Page 305</a>   There is a difference between what we have in this verse and what we find in  Romans 5:5 , "the <b>love</b> of God is shed abroad in our hearts"<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#306:1">Page 306</a>   It is so much before the mind of God that we should know His <b>love</b> that He has given His own Spirit to pour it out into our hearts, and then He has given us One who can lead our hearts into a region that is filled with it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#306:2">Page 306</a>   There is a region that is full of the <b>love</b> of God, and the Lord can lead us that way.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#306:4">Page 306</a>   The proper portion of the assembly would be implied here: if we are directed into the <b>love</b> of God it is that <b>love</b> that is enjoyed by His saints, not exactly an individual thing.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#307:29">Page 307</a>   If we had more <b>love</b> we should get the victory over a brother and win him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#316:21">Page 316</a>   "By <b>love</b> serve one another",  Galatians 5:13 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#324:26">Page 324</a>   All that the apostle speaks of as the moral character of saints, sobriety, gravity, discretion, <b>love</b> and patience; these are things that should be seen in the saints; they are the character and qualities of Christ worked out morally in the saints; they are things that have to be spoken about and exhorted.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#329:12">Page 329</a>   If I allow a bit of lawlessness I deny the Lord to that extent the pleasure of His <b>love</b>, and that is a serious thing.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#333:11">Page 333</a>   All that God will bring in of good, His kindness and <b>love</b> toward man, will appear publicly by and by; the world to come will be filled with it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#333:19">Page 333</a>   God will have the pleasure of His <b>love</b> in seeing man enjoy His goodness, and the display of it will come out in so far as we walk on the line of good works; that would be shewing out the character of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#337:19">Page 337</a>   That Onesimus might be received with the most unstinted <b>love</b>; he was not merely to be pardoned for his past delinquencies but received with an overflowing welcome as if he were Paul.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#338:8">Page 338</a>   If you do not respect the brethren you do not <b>love</b> them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#339:10">Page 339</a>  I think the great point is to see how the <b>love</b> of the writer invests Onesimus with great value.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#340:5">Page 340</a>   On the other hand there is this activity of <b>love</b> which is so refreshing, a going beyond all that is righteously due.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#340:8">Page 340</a>   He says, 'I want to get something out of you, Philemon; I want you to show an excess of <b>love</b> so that you may refresh my bowels'.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#341:4">Page 341</a>   That is the thoughtfulness and delicacy of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#341:5">Page 341</a>   This is the only principle on which brethren can walk together  --  the principle of <b>love</b> and confidence.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#341:23">Page 341</a>   <b>Love</b> is the motive.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#342:9">Page 342</a>   The epistle is full of <b>love</b> and mutual understanding.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#342:12">Page 342</a>   It is striking that <b>love</b> and faith are seen not only as active towards the Lord Jesus, but towards the saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#342:13">Page 342</a>   I suppose there could not really be faith in the Lord Jesus without <b>love</b> to those who are His.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#343:13">Page 343</a>   Faith fixes upon all that moves in the saints towards Christ Jesus, and there is no uniting in <b>love</b> apart from that.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#345:5">Page 345</a>   Faith and <b>love</b> are put together: "Hearing of thy <b>love</b> and the faith which thou hast".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#345:8">Page 345</a>   You could not have <b>love</b> without faith, or faith without <b>love</b>; they are twin sisters.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#345:16">Page 345</a>   There is nothing more delightful in Scripture than this little epistle as showing the activity of divine <b>love</b> in Paul and Philemon and his household, and this young brother brought out in his attractiveness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac23.htm#345:21">Page 345</a>   How this would tend to strengthen the bonds of <b>love</b> among us.<br>
<h3>Volume 24 - Notes of Readings on the Lord's Supper</h3>
<a href="../cac/cac24.htm#19:10">Page 19</a>   In this chapter you look at it; it is a cup larger than any cup you ever thought of, and it contains the <b>love</b> of God that comes to us through the death of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac24.htm#20:20">Page 20</a>   The blessing that is in the heart of God and in the <b>love</b> of God comes to us in the value of the blood of Christ, that is the side of blessing.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac24.htm#26:3">Page 26</a>   So the greatest expenditure of <b>love</b> has been put forth that we might take what will fill eternity.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac24.htm#27:7">Page 27</a>   We first appropriate, that is we see that divine <b>love</b> invites us to take possession of all that is signified by a divine Person coming into Manhood, but with that -- the loaf taken -- there is the thought of eating.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac24.htm#28:8">Page 28</a>   We may ourselves become sacramental as if deriving something from the action, instead of being on this line, that we have taken what divine <b>love</b> has made available in Christ, and have really eaten it and made it part of ourselves.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac24.htm#37:23">Page 37</a>   <b>Love</b> is infinitely wise, and there is no better means than the Lord's supper to bring this about.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac24.htm#38:19">Page 38</a>   It is not Christ after the flesh that we call to mind, it is a living Christ known in <b>love</b> which has been expressed in death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac24.htm#39:20">Page 39</a>   He says, Now I want the saints of the assembly to call me to mind in that manner; we come into the apprehension of the <b>love</b> of the Christ that we know.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac24.htm#53:17">Page 53</a>   When He says, "I am coming to you", He comes to serve us, and chapters 13 - 17 are a real, actual, living example of how He serves His own in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac24.htm#54:1">Page 54</a>   Chapters 13 - 17 are full of His service in <b>love</b> for His own.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac24.htm#55:1">Page 55</a>   He says, I am going to put the teaching of it in such a spiritual way that it will not be understood unless there is reciprocity and <b>love</b>.<br>
<h3>Volume 25 - Outlines of the Epistles of Paul to the Corinthians</h3>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#3:15">Page 3</a>   "His Son" sets forth, firstly the full light of the outshining of God; we are called into a circle where the effulgence of God shines in the Person of His Son; and, secondly, that God has established all the pleasure of His <b>love</b> in a Man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#3:16">Page 3</a>   He has found in His Son an answer to all His <b>love</b> and He is restful in it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#6:10">Page 6</a>   How can we know His embrace of <b>love</b> then, if through the week we have not been true to the fellowship?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#6:12">Page 6</a>   It is the direct fruit of divine calling and the calling is the fruit of divine <b>love</b> and brings dignity with it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#7:16">Page 7</a>   They had reverted largely to the wrong man and Paul does not come down on them in a withering way, but, in the skill of divine <b>love</b>, he showed how the cross had governed his own service among them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#14:4">Page 14</a>   He made them eat the flesh of the lamb so that they might be nourished in the wonderful self-sacrificing <b>love</b> set forth in the passover.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#14:5">Page 14</a>   It was the righteousness of God revealed in the way of grace and <b>love</b> so that all their fears might be removed and they might be secured for God's pleasure.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#17:25">Page 17</a>   I must <b>love</b> them all; I must pray for them all; I must lay myself out for them all in as far as I am able.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#20:3">Page 20</a>   He knew the <b>love</b> of the blessed God in a sorrowing and suffering heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#20:4">Page 20</a>   Israel never knew that, the church is privileged to know the <b>love</b> of God like that.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#21:7">Page 21</a>   I think it means getting into that which divine <b>love</b> has in view for us at the present time, of which we may possibly come short.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#23:22">Page 23</a>   God had given them the very best that <b>love</b> could give.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#39:28">Page 39</a>   And it is wonderful that His supremacy in <b>love</b> has come out in His giving up His body in manhood and His blood being poured out<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#40:3">Page 40</a>   He is asserting in it His title as to what is due to Him, that all His saints take His supper rightly, for He is asserting the claim of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#40:7">Page 40</a>   I think that is why the title of Lord is emphasised  --  it is a claim of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#41:18">Page 41</a>   We do not like to think of anybody doing it otherwise than as answering to the claim of the Lord's <b>love</b>, do we?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#42:1">Page 42</a>   If we understand that all that came out in that holy body was devoted in <b>love</b> for the assembly in death, it leads to a response in <b>love</b> so sweet and wondrous.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#46:8">Page 46</a>   The Supper is the Lord's way, the way of divine <b>love</b>, to mould and form our affections so that we might be together without a jarring note, without any disorder, that we might be together as the assembly of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#46:10">Page 46</a>   The fact that the Lord has taken this simple means (nothing could be more simple outwardly, nothing more profound inwardly and spiritually) in the wisdom of His <b>love</b> shows that there is no better way.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#46:14">Page 46</a>   It is as wide as the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#48:13">Page 48</a>   The Lord views the assembly as great enough to answer to His own <b>love</b> for it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#49:19">Page 49</a>   Now if the brother who breaks the bread does not do it in serving <b>love</b> he would not convey any impression of what the Supper really means.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#50:8">Page 50</a>   It is only as we get into the thoughts of His <b>love</b> that we have the Person before us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#50:12">Page 50</a>   It is a concentrated appeal of divine <b>love</b> to us and it enshrines every moving influence that the Lord could present to us in order to mould our affections.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#51:11">Page 51</a>   It is most wonderful to think that such a Person, having come in such a body into this world, would go into death, would give His body in death, in order that the assembly might be secured for all that is the pleasure and delight of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#52:9">Page 52</a>   It is suggested by <b>love</b> and it appeals to <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#52:11">Page 52</a>   I have no doubt it is intended to bring together and keep together the company of those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#52:12">Page 52</a>   It is nothing to those who do not <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#52:23">Page 52</a>   The Lord has been most gracious in His <b>love</b> in giving us a material and tangible act.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#53:17">Page 53</a>   Beloved brethren, the Lord loves to be called to mind in that supreme moment when His <b>love</b> and the <b>love</b> of God found full expression as He gave Himself for the assembly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#54:17">Page 54</a>   We have to feel as we move about that the Lord is not here and is not wanted here, but we <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#55:22">Page 55</a>   <b>Love</b> must have the company of the loved objects; it is the desire of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#56:5">Page 56</a>   His <b>love</b> brings Him; His own pleasure brings Him there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#56:12">Page 56</a>   "If ye <b>love</b> me, keep my commandments .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#56:29">Page 56</a>   It is not a pitying and compassionate <b>love</b> like giving something to a poor beggar<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#58:13">Page 58</a>   It is important that we should call the Lord to mind in connection with what came out in His death, because it is the greatest expression of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#58:14">Page 58</a>   He will never again give such expression to His <b>love</b> as He did when He went into death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#58:15">Page 58</a>   But the <b>love</b> that was expressed then remains livingly in Himself; so when He says, "In remembrance of me" it is Himself as having gone to heaven.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#60:15">Page 60</a>   In the days of His flesh neither Peter nor John had any idea that His <b>love</b> was so great that it would take Him into death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#60:16">Page 60</a>   If we call the absent One to mind, all that was expressed in His death lives now in Himself, and the <b>love</b> in which He went into death now lives in His heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#60:20">Page 60</a>   All the <b>love</b> that was expended in His death lives in His own heart this minute.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#60:21">Page 60</a>  Here Paul is speaking to establish in their hearts the great fact that the Lord died, for they were having a sort of <b>love</b> feast and not thinking of the Lord at all.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#61:6">Page 61</a>   The Supper has in view the assembly as a company of persons down here in this world, in the wilderness position, understanding how the Lord has devoted Himself in <b>love</b> to them so as to awaken wifely affections towards Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#62:13">Page 62</a>   We <b>love</b> to distinguish the loaf as the Lord's body.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#62:19">Page 62</a>   And then it is a 'calling of Me to mind'; we think of the Lord affectionately in all the power of His <b>love</b> expressed in death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#62:20">Page 62</a>   For it is the same <b>love</b> exactly in glory; there is not one <b>love</b> in death and another in glory.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#63:7">Page 63</a>   It was the chastening of His <b>love</b> that His saints might be free of what was unworthy of Himself and of His supper.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#63:11">Page 63</a>   Where things start is in thinking of the Lord's <b>love</b> in death; and it is the same for the youngest as it is for the eldest, so that we all start together.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#76:1">Page 76</a>   That is, the gifts are all subordinated to <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#76:12">Page 76</a>  That is, <b>love</b> abides, the gifts are passing.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#76:13">Page 76</a>   You <b>love</b> to think there is a way of more surpassing excellence.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#76:15">Page 76</a>   But there is something greater than that  --  the way of more surpassing excellence, and one most inferior as to his place in the body can be exalted to the highest possible degree in the experimental knowledge of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#76:18">Page 76</a>   But when I move in <b>love</b> I am conscious that I am on the line of what is eternal.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#77:18">Page 77</a>   Are you suggesting that <b>love</b> is equivalent to the blood in the natural body?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#78:5">Page 78</a>   We have to recognise that the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, is not only active in the way of conferring gifts, which operate in power by the Spirit, but He is also operating on the line of <b>love</b> and that is internal.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#78:6">Page 78</a>   The gifts are external, indeed they are spoken of as manifestations; but then there is also the power, the working of the Spirit on the line of life, so that the body can be a living organism animated vitally by <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#78:8">Page 78</a>   It has often been said that chapter 12 is power, chapter 13 is <b>love</b>, and chapter 14 the spirit of wise discretion.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#78:9">Page 78</a>  The apostle therefore does not hesitate to say that if he had the most remarkable gifts and was lacking in <b>love</b>, he had nothing.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#78:12">Page 78</a>  If we think of it, how could it be in any spiritual sense the body of Christ if it were not animated by <b>love</b>?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#78:14">Page 78</a>   It is good for us to accept the fact; we are only in the body of Christ as moved by <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#78:15">Page 78</a>  It is such a character of <b>love</b> as could not have been found in Old Testament times.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#78:16">Page 78</a>   There could not have been a body in the Old Testament in that sense; there was no power adequate for the forming of a body in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#78:25">Page 78</a>   Ephesians shows the body building itself up in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#79:3">Page 79</a>   When we come to the body in its highest aspect we find inward energies of the body are for the self-building up of itself in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#79:11">Page 79</a>   Yes, I think it is clear that there might be much gift and little <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#79:14">Page 79</a>   <b>Love</b> would have put that right.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#79:15">Page 79</a>   If <b>love</b> is not there, God is not in the matter and it is absolutely worthless.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#79:16">Page 79</a>   Gift is a manifestation of <b>love</b>; it operates in <b>love</b> if it is genuine and the <b>love</b> is greater than the gift.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#79:18">Page 79</a>   The gifts will pass away, <b>love</b> goes on.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#79:22">Page 79</a>   It was gift that was not being exercised in <b>love</b> but was making much of the person who had it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#80:2">Page 80</a>   It has often been said how humbling it is to read it, but I do not think the apostle wrote it to humble them, but as alluring them, that they might follow this wonderful character of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#80:4">Page 80</a>   We should do well to ask ourselves, 'How would <b>love</b> behave in this case?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#80:7">Page 80</a>   <b>Love</b> has been set forth perfectly in Him, and particularly, of course, in His death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#80:8">Page 80</a>   The Lord's supper is the point where we learn <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#80:11">Page 80</a>   He regards <b>love</b> as something we possess.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#80:12">Page 80</a>   "If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not <b>love</b>" and in verse 2, "but have not <b>love</b>", and again in verse 3, "but have not <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#80:14">Page 80</a>   I shall never give any expression of <b>love</b> until I possess it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#80:15">Page 80</a>   It is really the apprehension of <b>love</b> in divine Persons; we have it there, but it is to become formative in us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#80:18">Page 80</a>   It is supposed to take practical form in us, so he later on tries to show us how <b>love</b> will be there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#80:21">Page 80</a>   "<b>Love</b> has long patience".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#80:27">Page 80</a>   The point with <b>love</b> is, after it has been tested it remains kind.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#81:9">Page 81</a>   The loaf and the cup are not set before us that we may merely look, but that we may eat and drink, and we eat and drink our way into divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#81:12">Page 81</a>   The Lord's supper is the great tangible expression of divine <b>love</b> that will never be repeated.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#81:14">Page 81</a>   And we are to live on it, so that our spiritual constitution is formed in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#82:2">Page 82</a>   The greatest gift we could think of  --  an apostle  --  without <b>love</b> (and Judas was an apostle without <b>love</b>, which shows what a terrible thing it is) was the "son of perdition".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#82:6">Page 82</a>   Would Peter and John be gift and <b>love</b> combined?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#82:11">Page 82</a>   I may be small in gift but great in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#82:12">Page 82</a>   Gift is limited but there is no limitation in the divine nature  --  <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#82:14">Page 82</a>   I am nothing in the body if I am not characterised by <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#83:6">Page 83</a>   There will be <b>love</b> that pervades the whole scene; every one will be filled with <b>love</b> and be in a scene of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#83:8">Page 83</a>  "<b>Love</b> .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#83:15">Page 83</a>   "<b>Love</b> .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#83:18">Page 83</a>   believes all things" is a general statement; it is the comprehensive way in which <b>love</b> acts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#83:25">Page 83</a>  Was it not the very absence of <b>love</b> that made all the defects and deficiencies at Corinth?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#83:26">Page 83</a>   I am to go on with these features of <b>love</b>, and if I see any one doing wrong I am to speak to that person in <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#84:2">Page 84</a>   In chapter 5 a wicked person has to be removed; you must not use <b>love</b> to cover up sin in the sense of passing it by.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#84:3">Page 84</a>   It is good to be among the brethren and feel that the divine nature is operating in every brother and sister and we want to help that on and encourage it; Paul is showing that <b>love</b> never fails.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#87:3">Page 87</a>   And then, before speaking of the working out of things locally, the beautiful 13th chapter comes in to show that it can only be worked out locally in the spirit of <b>love</b>, "Follow after <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#87:4">Page 87</a>   <b>Love</b> has been set before us in chapter 11.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#87:5">Page 87</a>   The Supper brings before us the great manifestation of <b>love</b>, and what is set before us in the Supper is to be a model; everything in the assembly is to conform to the Supper as a model.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#88:3">Page 88</a>   I suppose if it is of God, all that God says is in <b>love</b>, and the vessel would be characterised by that.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#88:8">Page 88</a>   We have the <b>love</b> of divine Persons brought before us in the Supper; the <b>love</b> of Christ and the <b>love</b> of God told out in their full extent; and then this wonderful picture of <b>love</b> acting in detail in chapter 13.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#88:9">Page 88</a>   We have <b>love</b> in its concentration set forth in the loaf and the cup.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#88:10">Page 88</a>   Divine <b>love</b> is concentrated there, and then the 13th chapter shews us <b>love</b> acting in detail.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#88:11">Page 88</a>   So that every kind of circumstance brings out some peculiar phase of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#91:8">Page 91</a>   This is not wanting something to make us important; it is the desire begotten in the soul by the enjoyment of divine <b>love</b>, and by the possession of divine substance.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#97:2">Page 97</a>   So chapter 13 comes in to show that the gifts only serve their purpose as they are moved by <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#98:9">Page 98</a>   "<b>Love</b> is not emulous",  1 Corinthians 13:4 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#108:5">Page 108</a>   Wonderful things happened; the veil of the temple was rent from the top to the bottom the moment Christ died  --  the course was clear for God to come out in the blessedness of His <b>love</b> to men.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#111:17">Page 111</a>   I do not think the outward man in Paul perished in a natural way, but in the service of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#111:19">Page 111</a>   If you had stripped the clothes off Paul you would have seen the marks he bore in his body of his devotion to Christ in the service of <b>love</b> here.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#111:20">Page 111</a>   The dying of Jesus was seen in the evidence there: you could see how he had expended himself in the service of <b>love</b>; that is the life of Jesus, a life of suffering <b>love</b> that goes down to death here, but that claims resurrection as its divine answer.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#112:7">Page 112</a>   His very Person carried the evidence of a suffering <b>love</b> that had never spared itself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#112:20">Page 112</a>   He will never lose in the eyes of His saints the attractiveness of what He suffered in the service of His <b>love</b>  --  it must all come out in resurrection.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#115:8">Page 115</a>  There are the two lines: what God effects in the saints by His work, so that in result He raises them for His world; and that God brings down the glory of His eternal purpose, and clothes His saints with it for the satisfaction of His own <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#116:18">Page 116</a>   It has been said, and I think it is right, that the second Man is the thought of pattern, and all that God has in view in the purpose of His <b>love</b> is patterned in the second Man, and He is out of heaven<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#142:1">Page 142</a>  INCORRUPTIBLE AFFECTIONS 1 Corinthians 11:23  - 26;  John 14:15  - 18;  Ephesians 6:23 , 24 The exercise I have had in view of our coming together was that there should be something to promote spiritual affections  --  something that would lead to enlarged ability to <b>love</b> our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#143:1">Page 143</a>   "Them that <b>love</b> our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption" is a beautiful description of the saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#143:2">Page 143</a>   It comes in the closing verses of the epistle which gives the full height of our calling, and it seems to suggest that everything is open to us if we <b>love</b> our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#143:10">Page 143</a>   Those who <b>love</b> our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption are ready at any moment to be caught up to meet Him in the air.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#144:6">Page 144</a>   I have no doubt it is by learning a <b>love</b> which is in incorruption, made known to us in our Lord Jesus Christ, and by appropriating that <b>love</b> in our affections.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#144:9">Page 144</a>   He brings us under the influence of a <b>love</b> that is in itself incorruptible.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#144:13">Page 144</a>   The Lord would nourish our affections on the fact that His body has been devoted to us in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#144:15">Page 144</a>   What He has done for us is most blessed, and we could have no spiritual blessing without it, but what He suggests to us in the Supper is His infinite devotion to us in <b>love</b>, and that becomes the spring of affections which can be said to be "in incorruption".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#145:14">Page 145</a>   Think of that body being devoted in <b>love</b> to the assembly!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#145:17">Page 145</a>   That was <b>love</b> in incorruption.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#146:1">Page 146</a>   Speaking in the language of the New Testament she had to learn Him in the devotion of His suffering <b>love</b> in which He gave His body for her.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#146:2">Page 146</a>   All moral loveliness came out in His body  --  He was "altogether lovely"  --  but He has devoted that body in supreme <b>love</b> for the assembly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#146:4">Page 146</a>   Unfading and incorruptible <b>love</b> on His part calls into activity incorruptible affections on the part of the assembly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#146:12">Page 146</a>   Every one who loves Him in incorruption carries a sense of His <b>love</b> all the time.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#147:5">Page 147</a>   The bride says, " My  breasts like towers" ( Song of Songs 8:10 ); those are fully developed affections; they are brought about under the influence of the devoted <b>love</b> of Christ as set before us in the Lord's supper.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#147:20">Page 147</a>   It is not only that lawlessness and idolatry are set aside, and there is no dearth or death-shadow, but God is known in <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#148:11">Page 148</a>   The first question is, How have we been affected by the <b>love</b> of Christ and the <b>love</b> of God which has been brought to us, and which is kept fresh in our affections by the continual recurrence every first day of the week of the Lord's supper?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#148:12">Page 148</a>   As we call Him to mind in affectionate remembrance He gets His place, though absent, as the Object of <b>love</b> "in incorruption".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#148:13">Page 148</a>  The <b>love</b> of the assembly is actively awakened by what is recalled of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#148:14">Page 148</a>   Incorruptible affections are nourished and cherished and enlarged under the influence of His <b>love</b> and God's <b>love</b>.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#148:23">Page 148</a>   From  John 14:15  all turns on "If ye <b>love</b> me".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#148:24">Page 148</a>   It is not, "I have loved you"; He has said that in  John 13 , but now He says, "If ye <b>love</b> me".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#148:25">Page 148</a>  He says as it were, I will tell you the great gain which accrues to those who <b>love</b> Me in incorruption<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#149:2">Page 149</a>   How deeply the Lord is affected, and how truly He is attracted, by the <b>love</b> of the assembly!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#149:3">Page 149</a>  We can speak very confidently about His <b>love</b> for the assembly, but in  John 14:15  it is the assembly's <b>love</b> for Him, and how He answers to it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#149:5">Page 149</a>   In the Song of Songs He says to His loved one, "How much better is thy <b>love</b> than wine!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#149:6">Page 149</a>  " She had said, "Thy <b>love</b> is better than wine", but He says, "How much better is thy <b>love</b> than wine!<br>

<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#149:13">Page 149</a>   The Comforter  --  the Holy Spirit  --  comes to be the abiding support of those who <b>love</b> our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#149:16">Page 149</a>   While the Lord was here He carried on an unceasing service of personal <b>love</b>, but now that He has gone to the Father we have the Comforter.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#149:19">Page 149</a>  Another thought seems to me to be closely connected with the incorruptible affections which have been called into being by the activities of sovereign <b>love</b>, and that is suggested by the character in which the Lord comes to His own<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#150:5">Page 150</a>   He would come to those who <b>love</b> Him to renew those blessed influences that would bring the Father and the Father's <b>love</b> near to them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#150:10">Page 150</a>  How delightful it must be to the Father to have sons before Him in association with Christ  --  to have those whose affections are at home in the relationship which His <b>love</b> has established!<br>

<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#150:16">Page 150</a>   It is the supreme desire of His heart that we should know the Father's <b>love</b><br>

<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#151:5">Page 151</a>   When He comes to us we find ourselves consciously with Him in the presence of the Father's <b>love</b>; we know that He is there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#151:8">Page 151</a>   It is <b>love</b> in incorruption that secures this unspeakable favour.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#154:14">Page 154</a>   He knows God in grace and <b>love</b> through the gospel.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#156:3">Page 156</a>   Everything that was due to us came upon Him, and was endured by Him in infinite <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#156:12">Page 156</a>   But if Christ Jesus came into the world in <b>love</b> to bear my sins, and to be made sin sacrificially on my behalf, and to die for me  --  and He did all this by the grace of God  --  what is there left for God to take account of in regard to me?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#156:18">Page 156</a>   We adore Him for the <b>love</b> in which He took that place.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#157:2">Page 157</a>   He came into these things in divine <b>love</b> to us but now He is apart from them all for ever.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#160:17">Page 160</a>   Christ has gone to the Father to prepare a place for us; He is holding that place in the Father's <b>love</b> for us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#161:8">Page 161</a>  THINGS WRITTEN FOR OUR ADMONITION 1 Corinthians 10:1  - 13 There are some parts of Scripture that are attractive to the hearts of all believers because they present the grace of God or the Person and <b>love</b> of Christ in a special way.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#163:12">Page 163</a>   God would not only provide a shelter from deserved judgment, but in presence of all the power of the enemy He would cover them with the cloud of His power and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#163:14">Page 163</a>   In His <b>love</b> and in His pity He redeemed them to make Himself an everlasting and glorious Name.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#163:15">Page 163</a>   In His everlasting <b>love</b> He overshadowed the people with the cloud of His presence.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#164:3">Page 164</a>   He is for them in the most absolute way; they are under the guardian cloud of His power and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#170:11">Page 170</a>   Hence the apostle John in writing to those who were strong and had the word of God abiding in them and had overcome the wicked one, exhorts them to "<b>love</b> not the world".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#174:3">Page 174</a>   If heavenly things, the things connected with divine <b>love</b> and purpose, are put before them they look upon them merely as beautiful sentiments of no practical value, and as quite inaccessible to all but perhaps a very few.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#174:4">Page 174</a>   They do not respond to the <b>love</b> and purpose of God and they do not count on His power.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#176:13">Page 176</a>   The first is the grace of God, the second is the faithfulness of God, the third is the presence of the Holy Spirit and the fourth is the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#183:7">Page 183</a>   God has brought to pass all His thoughts and all His purposes; He has fulfilled the counsel of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#184:13">Page 184</a>   I read that scripture because it seems to me that the great thing that comes out in connection with the Lord's supper is divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#184:14">Page 184</a>   And I do not know anything that has power to subdue what is of the flesh like divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#184:15">Page 184</a>   The Corinthians were going on with the outward act of eating the Lord's supper, but it is very clear that it had ceased to be to them the voice of divine <b>love</b>, so they were not subdued, they were not lowly in heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#184:16">Page 184</a>   They were eating the Supper in a merely external way, without being really in the presence of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#185:2">Page 185</a>   The bread and the cup speak of that in which His <b>love</b> has found its most profound and blessed expression; He loves His saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#185:3">Page 185</a>   And the second thing is that His saints <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#185:4">Page 185</a>   The Lord's supper is the most simple thing conceivable; if you look at it from a natural point of view it is a company of people come together to break bread and to drink of the cup; but what makes it so great and blessed is that there is a company here of those who <b>love</b> the One who died.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#185:5">Page 185</a>   It is by His death that He has put the seal of His <b>love</b> for ever on our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#185:6">Page 185</a>   And the third thing is that they <b>love</b> one another.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#185:8">Page 185</a>   The Lord loves His saints, and His saints <b>love</b> Him, and they <b>love</b> one another.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#185:9">Page 185</a>   It is a circle of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#185:10">Page 185</a>  We do not learn divine <b>love</b> by reading about it, or hearing about it, or even by praying about it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#185:11">Page 185</a>   We learn divine <b>love</b> in the circle where it is at home, and when the Lord brings His own together to eat His supper, He binds their hearts to Himself and to one another in the immediate presence of His living <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#185:12">Page 185</a>   It is there we learn divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#185:15">Page 185</a>   I am Judas, I am the man that is not a bit affected by the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#185:16">Page 185</a>   There was a man who did not care a bit about the <b>love</b> of Christ, and the flesh in you and me does not care any more about the <b>love</b> of Christ than Judas did.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#185:17">Page 185</a>   He was insensible to the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#185:18">Page 185</a>   But if we have been born of God and have been brought into the circle of grace and been taught of God, we become very sensitive to the blessed <b>love</b> of Christ, and He brings us to the Supper in order to bring us under the influence of that <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#186:6">Page 186</a>   We have to be built up in the consciousness of divine <b>love</b>, the <b>love</b> that has been expressed in the death of Christ and is continually brought afresh to our hearts in the Lord's supper.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#186:7">Page 186</a>   This is the line of edification, and the result would be that we are all bound together and consider one another in <b>love</b>, just as in the natural body every member serves all the other members in unselfish <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#186:10">Page 186</a>   There is perfect unselfish <b>love</b> in the members of the natural body, and in the same way with the body of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#186:11">Page 186</a>   The saints are bound together in the knowledge of the grace of God and His faithfulness, and in all that subsists here in the power of the Spirit and in the knowledge of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#186:15">Page 186</a>   The result would be that the whole body bound together would be nourished, ministered to, and would edify itself in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#199:20">Page 199</a>   I think the starting point on our side is that the Spirit is given to shed the <b>love</b> of God abroad in our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#200:1">Page 200</a>   Then the <b>love</b> of God is brought in: "the <b>love</b> of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us"  --  we find the Spirit is there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#200:3">Page 200</a>   There is the wonderful display that God has made of Himself in declaring His righteousness and power and <b>love</b>, and all is gathered up now in a risen Man; all that was displayed in the cross and resurrection subsists before God in a risen Man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#200:4">Page 200</a>   There is the profound sense in the heart of the <b>love</b> of God poured out there; it is an unmistakable experience.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#200:5">Page 200</a>   We learn the <b>love</b> of God in the death of Christ, and a risen Christ is our righteousness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#202:15">Page 202</a>   which God has given to those that obey him"; in connection with <b>love</b>  --  "If ye <b>love</b> me .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#202:22">Page 202</a>   God, in introducing faith, brought here all the elements of divine purity: we have a risen and glorified Man as the object of faith and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#202:23">Page 202</a>   It is surely a purified heart which has that object for its trust and <b>love</b>; no heart is purified apart from that<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#208:10">Page 208</a>   The body is connected with the bread, and the cup is connected with drinking into divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#209:1">Page 209</a>   He did not stay away in a judicial spirit  --  as if he said, 'You are so bad that I cannot come'  --  but he stayed away in the spirit of <b>love</b>: he would not go till every occasion of grief had been removed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#209:14">Page 209</a>   It is the outcome of abiding in divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#209:15">Page 209</a>   The Lord could speak of "My joy"  --  He kept the Father's commandments and abode in His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#209:16">Page 209</a>   He did the Father's will in everything; there was nothing in the blessed Lord to hinder the fulness of His joy in the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#209:17">Page 209</a>   If the flesh is not allowed and divine <b>love</b> is working, there is nothing to hinder joy.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#209:18">Page 209</a>   It is part of the fruit of the Spirit  --  <b>love</b>, joy, peace  --  that is the order.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#209:19">Page 209</a>  The apostle had to write very severe things to the saints at Corinth, but he had not written that they might be grieved but that they might know the <b>love</b> he had very abundantly towards them<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#210:1">Page 210</a>   It was the action of <b>love</b> on his part, and we may say on theirs too, because it was the divine nature in them that responded to the first epistle.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#210:8">Page 210</a>   It is beautiful to see the tender grace of Christ that, directly the man was broken, there was an open hand to show <b>love</b> to him: directly the barrier is down the <b>love</b> of Christ can flow freely.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#210:15">Page 210</a>   The Spirit of Christ would give us right sensibilities, so that we should know when it is the time to rebuke and when to assure a person of our <b>love</b>: there is a time for everything.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#213:9">Page 213</a>   What a triumph to have such a man in this world who had the same <b>love</b> as Christ, not the same amount but the same character of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#213:10">Page 213</a>   The <b>love</b> of Christ never fails; He loves to the end, so there was a sweet odour of Christ about the apostle.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#216:15">Page 216</a>   His stooping to write was a twice repeated figure of His coming down from heaven to write the <b>love</b> of God in the dust of death, and that was the cross; it was written there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#216:16">Page 216</a>   He stooped to write all the revelation of God's <b>love</b> to men.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#216:23">Page 216</a>   It is the light of divine <b>love</b>; <b>love</b> has come in as light.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#216:24">Page 216</a>   We put light and <b>love</b> as if they were a contrast, but the light that shone in Jesus is the light of divine <b>love</b>: 'The light of <b>love</b> has shone in Thee,  And in that <b>love</b> our souls are free'.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#217:1">Page 217</a>   It is wonderful to think of all that was concentrated in the death of Christ; all the telling out of divine <b>love</b> is now written in myriads of hearts from the glory by the same Person who wrote it in the dust of death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#217:19">Page 217</a>   It is the <b>love</b> of God that is written.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#217:21">Page 217</a>   They delight to do His will because they know and <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#218:1">Page 218</a>   If you tell him that God is <b>love</b> and that Christ has died for him, it only shows what a contrast he is: he is not <b>love</b>, he is just the opposite, so it condemns him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#218:14">Page 218</a>   When the heart is touched by the Spirit, a man is subdued; there is an inlet for the <b>love</b> of God into his heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#222:23">Page 222</a>  How can men know the <b>love</b> of God?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#222:24">Page 222</a>   Only by the Spirit shedding abroad the <b>love</b> of God in their hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#223:1">Page 223</a>   But I did not touch the <b>love</b> of God till I got the Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#223:2">Page 223</a>   Many read that verse, a beautiful word, and they get comfort out of it, but they do not get the spring of it till the Spirit pours out the <b>love</b> of God; then the spring of it is in our hearts and we can enjoy it a thousand times more than before.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#226:31">Page 226</a>   It is a mystery but it is known to faith and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#228:26">Page 228</a>   If the covenant is known as we are looking at it here, there must be springs of <b>love</b> to God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#228:27">Page 228</a>   It says, "If any one <b>love</b> God,  he  is known of him",  1 Corinthians 8:3 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#228:37">Page 228</a>   It liberates us when we get to divine thoughts and divine <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#265:8">Page 265</a>   The <b>love</b> of Christ is the motive of service, "The <b>love</b> of the Christ constrains us".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#265:19">Page 265</a>   It is a solemn thought that all are dead; that is the judgment you come to as being in the embrace of the <b>love</b> of Christ: "one died for all, then all have died".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#265:26">Page 265</a>   If we think of God's <b>love</b>, and His purpose in Christ, and all the blessed things He has prepared and freely given, we can let ourselves go and there is no need for restraint; but, when it is a question of the saints, we have to consider what we say or do.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#266:9">Page 266</a>   The expression, "the <b>love</b> of Christ", only occurs three times in the New Testament  --  here, in  Romans 8:35  and in  Ephesians 3:19 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#266:12">Page 266</a>   It is the <b>love</b> of the Man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#266:15">Page 266</a>   In  Romans 8  it is the <b>love</b> of the Priest, in Ephesians it is the <b>love</b> of the Head, and here it is connected with the Lord.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#266:18">Page 266</a>   There is something peculiarly touching about the <b>love</b> of Christ, that blessed anointed Man; we have His <b>love</b> as Priest and as Head, as you say.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#266:21">Page 266</a>   The triumph of His <b>love</b> is that He secures a company absolutely devoted to Himself, and that is for the pleasure of God in reconciliation.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#266:22">Page 266</a>   That <b>love</b> embraces the soul; it is the <b>love</b> of Christ that holds us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#266:24">Page 266</a>   It means that we are in the embrace of the <b>love</b> of Christ and held by it, and in this way we live, quickened by the voice and <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#267:4">Page 267</a>   This is the estimate of things that the soul who is in the embrace of the <b>love</b> of Christ comes to; we anticipate the glorified state.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#267:5">Page 267</a>   Old things are not yet actually passed away; we are in the same bodies and the system of the world goes on as it did but, in the mind and consciousness and judgment of the one who is in the embrace of the <b>love</b> of Christ, all these things are gone.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#268:3">Page 268</a>   The <b>love</b> of Christ is the spring of everything that is for the pleasure of God; the <b>love</b> of Christ in which He went into death will be the underlying cause of God's pleasure throughout the universe.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#268:4">Page 268</a>   We do not arrive at a divine thought save as we are held by the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#268:5">Page 268</a>   In the consecration of the priests, the blood of the ram of consecration was put on their right ear, right thumb, and right toe; that is, the whole man had to come under the devoted <b>love</b> of Christ told out in death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#268:10">Page 268</a>   If we are held by the <b>love</b> of Christ we come to this divine judgment.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#268:11">Page 268</a>   It is very important that this truth is put before us as the judgment of a man held by the <b>love</b> of Christ, and if this is so the blood will be on his ear.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#268:14">Page 268</a>   We should judge everything from the standpoint of the <b>love</b> of Christ that went into death; everything inconsistent with that is not worth anything to us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#269:2">Page 269</a>  There was only one way in which the <b>love</b> of Christ could touch men and that way was by dying for them; no other way could have helped man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#269:5">Page 269</a>   It shows the entire setting aside of man in the flesh; all were dead, so there was no use considering man any longer from the point of view of God's pleasure, but man's worthlessness had been demonstrated in the way of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#269:6">Page 269</a>   It is not that God came in with a smashing blow, but Christ came in in <b>love</b> and went into death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#269:7">Page 269</a>   If we are held by the <b>love</b> of Christ we drop man after the flesh altogether as dead and done with, because nothing whatever springs out of man in the flesh for God's pleasure.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#269:9">Page 269</a>   Everything for God's pleasure flows from the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#270:6">Page 270</a>   The point of the <b>love</b> of Christ here is the devoted <b>love</b> of a blessed Man who went into death to establish the delight of God in man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#270:13">Page 270</a>   It is so important that we should be held by the <b>love</b> of Christ, because then we should look at things as the <b>love</b> of Christ regards them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#270:15">Page 270</a>   "Glory to God in the highest", "On earth peace", "Good pleasure in men", these were the things in the heart of Christ when He went into death, and if the <b>love</b> of Christ holds us these are the things we shall be thinking about.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#270:17">Page 270</a>   The <b>love</b> of Christ takes in divine counsel.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#270:20">Page 270</a>   Christ appears in the universe in manhood in a power of <b>love</b> that can give effect to all the delights of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#270:28">Page 270</a>   There it is considering the claims of the Lord, for He has rights and claims, but here it is the attraction of <b>love</b> that if He died for all, then those who live are under the necessity of <b>love</b> to live to Him<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#271:13">Page 271</a>   Yes, they were held by the <b>love</b> of Christ so had a correct judgment; they wanted to be in the place where the Lord's interests were.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#271:22">Page 271</a>   Those who have been touched by the <b>love</b> of Christ and live to Him are in Christ, but it is in Christ as the risen One<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#280:3">Page 280</a>   Then the character of the service comes out, "In labours, in watchings, in fastings, in pureness, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in <b>love</b> unfeigned, in the word of truth, in the power of God .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#292:11">Page 292</a>   God rests in the saints; He dwells there, He has a place of rest among His people: 'Our God whom we have known,  Well known in Jesus' <b>love</b>,  Rests in the blessing of His own  Before Himself above'.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#299:15">Page 299</a>   When evil has come in among the saints divine <b>love</b> can never rest; Paul said in chapter 2, "I had no rest".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#299:16">Page 299</a>   Divine <b>love</b> never rests till things are put right and the point of salvation and purity is reached  --  "Ye have proved yourselves to be pure".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#300:8">Page 300</a>   They did <b>love</b> Paul at bottom; certain wretched men had diverted them for a time, but they did <b>love</b> him and Titus comes back and tells him so.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#302:33">Page 302</a>   How the apostle was in the good of  1 Corinthians 13 , for it was really <b>love</b> that produced all these fine feelings and sensibilities!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#305:17">Page 305</a>  We see the beautiful yearnings of divine <b>love</b> brought into exercise by the very disorders.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#305:18">Page 305</a>   It is as though it provided an occasion for the exercise of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#307:3">Page 307</a>   Not only abounding in <b>love</b> but in grace; it is a great test to show grace to one another.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#307:9">Page 307</a>   There is a difference between grace and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#307:10">Page 307</a>   Grace is <b>love</b> in activity; it is shown to each other.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#308:3">Page 308</a>   He does not speak by commandment, but puts it before them as an opportunity to show the genuineness of their <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#308:15">Page 308</a>   When Israel comes to the morning of the day of their salvation that is what they will be in all the beauty of holiness and in the freshness of first <b>love</b>; in all the freshness of morning dew they will be brought forth.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#309:7">Page 309</a>   I do not think God would have suffered the old dispensation to close without proving that He could have one person in this world to <b>love</b> Him with all her heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#309:21">Page 309</a>   But here it is not righteousness, but grace and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#309:22">Page 309</a>   In the first epistle they were not in a good state, so he insists on righteousness and tells them that the price has been paid, but in 2 Corinthians their hearts were captivated and they were constrained by <b>love</b> to give themselves.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#309:25">Page 309</a>  We ought to be exercised as to being spiritually complete: "Even as ye abound in every way, in faith, and word, and knowledge, and all diligence, and in <b>love</b> from you to us, that ye may abound in this grace also"<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#310:2">Page 310</a>   It reminds one of Paul's appeal to the Philippians: "If then there be any comfort in Christ, if any consolation of <b>love</b>, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and compassions",  Philippians 2:1 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#310:20">Page 310</a>   Men do not understand grace and <b>love</b>, but they understand money.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#313:14">Page 313</a>   He yearns over them; all his fears about them were the outcome of his <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#320:8">Page 320</a>   He shows them the way the <b>love</b> of Christ has wrought in himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#322:18">Page 322</a>   We have to find out how little we care to appropriate the resources of divine <b>love</b>; all those resources are for us!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#323:5">Page 323</a>   You go right down through your own wretchedness and misery to the bottom of it all and then you tap the everlasting springs of divine <b>love</b>; it is worth while going through a bit of exercise to get to that.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#326:9">Page 326</a>   Every wrong in the assembly he felt personally; every wrong and weakness was like a blow at his heart; it is really the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#342:5">Page 342</a>   The whole scope of promise in Christ and the operations of God in the saints that He may have the glory of what He has secured in Christ by them are measured by the <b>love</b> of God; so the breadth, length and height are equal.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#342:10">Page 342</a>   It is the <b>love</b> of God as conditioned by the sphere of His operations, the <b>love</b> of God in new covenant character.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#342:11">Page 342</a>   It is <b>love</b> that has taken account of what man is in all his distance, has taken account of conditions here, and met all, by what is Yea and Amen in Christ and by the powerful operations of the Spirit down here.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#342:12">Page 342</a>   It is not <b>love</b> on the purpose side.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#342:18">Page 342</a>   The saint groans, but in presence of all he is fully persuaded that nothing can separate him from the <b>love</b> of God in Christ  --  he has measured the height.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#342:20">Page 342</a>   Now you measure the height at the end of chapter 8: nothing can separate us from the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#342:22">Page 342</a>   He is so great He can bring in the <b>love</b> of God in all its perfection and apply it to everything found in this world.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#342:24">Page 342</a>   Evil is displaced by the <b>love</b> of God and God is known in His nature<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#343:2">Page 343</a>   We come very slowly to a true thought of the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#343:4">Page 343</a>   But God would have us know what man is to Him, how He values man in His <b>love</b>: "God so loved the world".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#343:7">Page 343</a>   The outcome of the <b>love</b> of God, of its activity, is that we realise we are in the hand of Christ today, and we sit down at His feet and hear His words.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#343:14">Page 343</a>   The apostle says, "The Lord direct your hearts into the <b>love</b> of God",  2 Thessalonians 3:5 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#343:15">Page 343</a>   Is it by the Lord that we get a right apprehension of <b>love</b>?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#343:18">Page 343</a>   In  Romans 5  the Spirit sheds the <b>love</b> of God abroad in our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#343:19">Page 343</a>   But the Lord directing our hearts into the <b>love</b> of God is an administrative action which we prove when we are together as we are today.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#343:20">Page 343</a>   The Spirit shedding the <b>love</b> of God is secret; it is what goes on in the heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#343:21">Page 343</a>   But the Lord is directing our hearts into the <b>love</b> of God as together this afternoon.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#344:13">Page 344</a>   But it seems to me that the height indicates the saints' apprehension of the <b>love</b> of God, the blessed source of all.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#344:16">Page 344</a>   The world to come will come under that influence, and what lies behind is the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#344:18">Page 344</a>   There is nothing that produces confidence like <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#345:6">Page 345</a>   The breadth, length and height are all divine, the divine mind established in Christ, the divine mind established by God's work in the saints, and His own blessed <b>love</b> the measure of both.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#347:4">Page 347</a>   We should have a divine standard before us, as established in Christ and knowing the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#348:8">Page 348</a>   We are then in a state to learn all that we are brought into by the grace and <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#353:22">Page 353</a>   I do not mean that you are not a believer in Jesus, but you have not come to Him in this blessed character as the resting place of God's pleasure, and as the One in whom all God's thoughts of <b>love</b> and grace are established, and also as the One in whom there is the perfect setting forth of all that God is.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#355:3">Page 355</a>   He is there  --  the eternal Object of the Father's delight and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#359:12">Page 359</a>   And all the promises of God, the establishment of God's thoughts of <b>love</b> and grace towards man, in Him are yea and in Him amen.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#364:12">Page 364</a>   If we go down into dust in the sense that death is upon us, how blessed it is to see Him go down into the dust of death to deliver us and to bring the <b>love</b> of God to us!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#373:17">Page 373</a>  The One who devoted Himself in the obedience of <b>love</b> to do the will of God according to  Psalm 40:7 , 8, will "make all things new" and be able to say, "It is done".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#374:10">Page 374</a>   In Him was the Yea to all God's will for man, and nothing could move Him from His obedience of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#376:3">Page 376</a>   He, and He alone, could take up the whole question of sin and sins in such a way as to maintain the divine glory in the highest possible degree, and open a way for divine grace and <b>love</b> to come out in blessing to men.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#376:11">Page 376</a>   The promises of God were the outcome of His purpose, and in that purpose infinite thoughts of blessing for man were treasured, in the accomplishment of which all God's attributes and His nature of holy <b>love</b> have been fully manifested.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#379:8">Page 379</a>   Many things which could have no place in connection with Adam even in innocence, <b>love</b>, grace, mercy, holiness and so on, are fully set forth in Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac25.htm#384:8">Page 384</a>   It is a rare privilege to live at a time when God is doing such wondrous things for the pleasure of His <b>love</b>, and presenting His thoughts and purposes to us so that we may apprehend, and have conscious knowledge of, things that are wholly of Himself.<br>
<h3>Volume 26 - Outline of Ephesians</h3>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#2:2">Page 2</a>   It must be to have a people holy and blameless before Him in <b>love</b>, that is in the divine nature, morally suitable to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#3:10">Page 3</a>   The burnt-offering is connected with the walk of the saints there: "Walk in <b>love</b>, even as the Christ loved us, and delivered himself up for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour" (chapter 5: 2).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#3:12">Page 3</a>   It is the new ground of acceptance for a people on earth, and it was the supreme expression of <b>love</b> on the part of Christ as found here for the pleasure of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#3:13">Page 3</a>   The burnt-offering is to be perpetuated in the saints; they are to walk in the same character, a character of sacrificial <b>love</b> in which one is prepared to suffer and surrender for the benefit of our fellow saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#5:4">Page 5</a>  God has chosen us in Christ to be holy and blameless before Him in <b>love</b>; that is what is suited to God as such.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#5:22">Page 5</a>   The delight and <b>love</b> of God and the Father centre in that glorious Man, and the saints are privileged to know what it is to be graced in Him<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#15:5">Page 15</a>   Then <b>love</b> to all the saints would show the divine nature in activity; one who loves all saints is no longer alienated from the life of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#16:17">Page 16</a>   God is <b>love</b> and none of the wisdom of God can be understood except by <b>love</b>, so the eyes of the heart need to be enlightened.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#19:7">Page 19</a>   The epistle supposes the condition of soul is there -- faith in the Lord Jesus and <b>love</b> to all the saints in order that there should be a proper foundation on which to work.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#22:14">Page 22</a>   It is purpose in chapter 1, "Chosen us in him before the world's foundation, that we should be holy and blameless before him in <b>love</b>; having marked us out beforehand for adoption through Jesus Christ to himself" (verses 4, 5).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#26:12">Page 26</a>   He was "rich in mercy" and He has "great <b>love</b> wherewith he loved us".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#26:13">Page 26</a>   The old woman was right when she said that she knew God loved her before she was born for there had been nothing to <b>love</b> since!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#33:8">Page 33</a>  In chapter 1 we see that God has marked us out for sonship "to the praise of the glory of his grace", and we have obtained an inheritance in Christ that "we should be to the praise of his glory"; but in chapter 2 we see what God is doing for the satisfaction of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#33:9">Page 33</a>  "God, being rich in mercy" comes in because of our state and condition; nothing but the wealth of mercy could have met us, but on God's side it is "because of his great <b>love</b> wherewith he loved us".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#33:10">Page 33</a>   God has taken us up, not only in the depth of mercy, but to satisfy His own <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#33:12">Page 33</a>   The object in view in all this is that we may be brought consciously into the presence of the holy <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#33:13">Page 33</a>  In Old Testament times men were not in the presence of the <b>love</b> of God<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#34:1">Page 34</a>   I have no doubt the Old Testament saints knew something of God as being rich in mercy, but it was impossible they could know Him in the satisfaction of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#34:2">Page 34</a>   The reason is simple: the Object which alone could furnish satisfaction to the <b>love</b> of God was not yet revealed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#34:7">Page 34</a>   The Father's <b>love</b> found its perfect repose in that blessed One, and He found His repose in the <b>love</b> of which he was the Object -- He was "in the bosom of the Father" ( John 1:18 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#34:8">Page 34</a>  But the beloved Son was alone in the presence of the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#34:11">Page 34</a>   Sinful flesh could not be brought into the presence of God's <b>love</b>, but it has been condemned in the death of Christ; and another thing, that condition of being, human life in flesh and blood, with which in us sin and death have come into contact, has been brought to an end before God in the death of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#34:15">Page 34</a>   He now lives in resurrection in the presence of God's holy <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#34:16">Page 34</a>  The great thing for us is to see that God would bring us to live together with Him in the presence of that wondrous <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#34:17">Page 34</a>   To be quickened together with Christ is to be made to live in spirit outside everything that has been touched by sin or that has come under death in the presence of God's holy <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#35:8">Page 35</a>   It was <b>love</b> that qualified Mary to receive this message and to carry it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#35:10">Page 35</a>   The most important qualification of a gift is the jealousy of <b>love</b> that the message should not be marred in any way.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#35:16">Page 35</a>   He would have them to know that they lived with Him in the presence of the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#36:11">Page 36</a>   God would have us in perfect repose in a scene of absolute rest, and there in the presence of His <b>love</b> and for the satisfaction of that <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#36:18">Page 36</a>   God is fully revealed in <b>love</b> and we approach Him through Christ and by one Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#37:15">Page 37</a>   A man bowing his knees to the Father and strengthened by the Father's Spirit, so that Christ dwells in his heart through faith, will surely be "rooted and founded in <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#38:1">Page 38</a>   His roots strike down into the rich soil of divine <b>love</b> and he draws thence invigoration for his whole moral being.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#38:6">Page 38</a>   The Father is going to put the impress of Christ upon everything and Christ will fill all things with the light and <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#38:10">Page 38</a>  "And to know the <b>love</b> of the Christ which surpasses knowledge" (verse 19).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#38:11">Page 38</a>   This is a far wider thought than His <b>love</b> to us, blessed as that is.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#38:12">Page 38</a>   It is the deep devoted <b>love</b> in which He has taken up all the Father's counsels and will give full effect to them for the Father's glory.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#38:14">Page 38</a>   The Father would have us to see the wonderful place that Christ holds in relation to a 'vast universe of bliss', and how He will pervade it all with His own <b>love</b>, so that it may be filled with what answers perfectly to the Father.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#38:15">Page 38</a>   The <b>love</b> of Christ will extend to the utmost bounds of the universe of bliss.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#39:3">Page 39</a>   Then we are His bride, the peculiar, unique and glorious object of His <b>love</b>, presented to Himself for the satisfaction and delight of His heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#39:9">Page 39</a>   And the assembly is the vessel in which the fulness of God will shine forth, filling all things with light and <b>love</b> and blessedness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#40:10">Page 40</a>   It is what God thought of for the satisfaction of His own <b>love</b> when He had nothing to consider but that <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#41:12">Page 41</a>   I connect it with  1 Corinthians 2:7  - 10, "But we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, that hidden wisdom which God had predetermined before the ages for our glory: which none of the princes of this age knew, (for had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory;) but according as it is written, Things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that <b>love</b> him, but God has revealed to us by his Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#42:3">Page 42</a>   In eternity the only Man present in the divine mind was Christ, the Man of eternal purpose, and in that purpose all is according to the measure of Christ and the measure of the Father's <b>love</b> and that is immeasurable.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#42:6">Page 42</a>   The "all things" are the immeasurable system connected with the Father's <b>love</b> for the Son, and the Spirit connects us with it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#42:13">Page 42</a>   It is the whole expanse of the created universe from the height of heaven to the depths of hell, and not a thing in the universe can separate us from the <b>love</b> of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#42:15">Page 42</a>   If you had every power of the created universe against you, it is measurable, but you are linked up with the <b>love</b> of God in Christ and that is immeasurable.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#44:15">Page 44</a>   Now in  Ephesians 1:3  - 6 we read, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ; according as he has chosen us in him before the world's foundation, that we should be holy and blameless before him in <b>love</b>; having marked us out beforehand for adoption through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has taken us into favour in the Beloved".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#46:1">Page 46</a>   The greatest thought of all is that God should have the satisfaction of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#46:5">Page 46</a>   Christ was in God's purpose from eternity: He was not actually Man until He came to earth, born of the virgin, but He was Man in purpose, and God chose us in His holy Son that we should be holy and blameless before Him in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#47:2">Page 47</a>   In eternal purpose God was free to do what His <b>love</b> would have Him do.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#47:11">Page 47</a>   The sense of the absolute sovereignty of His mercy and His <b>love</b> puts us right with Him and makes us worshippers.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#47:13">Page 47</a>   This is connected with the depths of God in eternity: He was entitled to satisfy His own <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#47:22">Page 47</a>   It enables us, as strengthened by the Father's Spirit, to be rooted and founded in <b>love</b>: we get the blessed sense of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#47:23">Page 47</a>   <b>Love</b> is the spring of everything, and then we can apprehend with all saints the breadth, length, depth and height.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#48:1">Page 48</a>   How does the next word or two come in, "To know the <b>love</b> of the Christ"?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#48:6">Page 48</a>   The <b>love</b> of Christ is the <b>love</b> of the Head, and Christ is Head of every family.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#48:7">Page 48</a>   In this great system which has breadth and length and depth and height without measure, Christ is Head of every family, and His <b>love</b> is going to be the mainspring of response to the blessed God in every family eternally.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#48:8">Page 48</a>   That is what the <b>love</b> of Christ is, it is a provision for an adequate response to the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#48:13">Page 48</a>   Nothing is so high as the <b>love</b> of the Father for the Son; none of us will ever know what that is.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#48:14">Page 48</a>   We cannot understand the <b>love</b> of the Father for the Son in Deity -- that is beyond the creature -- but we can know the <b>love</b> of the Father to the Son in manhood for He prayed that "the <b>love</b> with which thou hast loved me may be in them",  John 17:26 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#48:17">Page 48</a>   There is nothing so high as the responsive <b>love</b> of Christ to the Father, the responsive <b>love</b> of the Head to bring every family to respond to the Father; that is height.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#48:21">Page 48</a>   Is it <b>love</b> to the Father?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#48:24">Page 48</a>   I think it is the <b>love</b> of the Head; He is the wonderful Head of this immeasurable system characterised by breadth, length, depth and height, created in the purpose of God and brought to pass in the power of the Spirit<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#49:1">Page 49</a>   Every part of this system is under the influence of a glorious Head who is characterised by surpassing <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#49:2">Page 49</a>   "To know the <b>love</b> of the Christ which surpasses knowledge"; that is immeasurable.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#49:4">Page 49</a>   The <b>love</b> of Christ is the spring that will make every part of the universe of bliss vibrate in response to the Father's <b>love</b> throughout the eternal day.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#51:2">Page 51</a>   But when we get to the eternal thoughts we see the delight of the Father in His Beloved in circumstances and conditions that are congenial to the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#51:11">Page 51</a>  When God has glorified Himself in relation to all that has come in, then He will rest in His <b>love</b> according to His eternal purpose.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#59:7">Page 59</a>   How it all brings before us the <b>love</b> and faithfulness of the One who has ascended above all the heavens!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#61:10">Page 61</a>   The saints, as having been brought up to the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ would not be carried away by winds of doctrine, "but, holding the truth in <b>love</b>" would "grow up to him in all things, who is the head, the Christ".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#62:2">Page 62</a>   For every joint and every band and each part to be supplying something for the encouragement and building up of the body would be "first works", which go along with "first <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#64:14">Page 64</a>   Nothing would move us more than  Ephesians 5  where we see the personal <b>love</b> of Christ to the assembly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#64:22">Page 64</a>   I suppose it sets forth the length to which His <b>love</b> is prepared to go; there is no thought of atonement or redemption in it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#64:23">Page 64</a>   The intensity and persistence and measure of His <b>love</b> is so great.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#64:24">Page 64</a>   It is sacrificial at the beginning of the chapter, "Walk in <b>love</b>, even as the Christ loved us, and delivered himself up for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour" (chapter 5: 2); that is sacrificial but I doubt if there is any such thought in the delivering up of Christ for the assembly<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#65:1">Page 65</a>   The death of Christ is viewed in this peculiar aspect that God is not brought into it; if you bring God in you bring in the sacrificial idea, but this aspect is Christ and the assembly, and Christ's <b>love</b> for the assembly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#65:3">Page 65</a>   It is the movements of Christ in <b>love</b> that He may have the assembly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#65:14">Page 65</a>   There is a hymn which just expresses it: 'By <b>love</b> constrained, Thy death we deem  Our point of severance from this scene  Where man Thy rights did spurn;  To us earth stands in shadow now,  (For Thou art absent), until Thou,  Lord Jesus, shalt return'.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#66:3">Page 66</a>   Yes, a subjection to the Head as known in <b>love</b> and the experience of union.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#66:7">Page 66</a>   We all know subjection to Christ as Lord; there are certain things due to Him; His commandments are to be obeyed; but it is a different thing to be united to Him in the bonds of <b>love</b> of which His death is the eternal witness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#67:2">Page 67</a>   The Lord's <b>love</b> will not have anything like that.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#67:11">Page 67</a>   It is not Lordship but a yielding to the known <b>love</b> of One with whom you are in conscious union; that is what makes it easy to yield.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#67:13">Page 67</a>   That is, no one ever hated his own flesh and men ought to <b>love</b> their wives as their own bodies.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#68:8">Page 68</a>   In chapter 13 He looks at the saints as loving in the same way that He loved: that is His own flesh; if I can <b>love</b> as Christ loves, I am of His flesh.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#69:6">Page 69</a>   You look for faith and <b>love</b> for Christ in the assembly and for Christ in the saints; that is how faith and <b>love</b> regards them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#70:6">Page 70</a>   Here it is not exactly as in Romans, which is on the line of lordship, but on the line of headship which works in affection and brings about submission on the line of <b>love</b>, a very happy condition.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#71:19">Page 71</a>   All this brings to us the sense of the intimacy and reality of the <b>love</b> of Christ; with all reverence we can say that Christ could not <b>love</b> what was unlovely.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#72:14">Page 72</a>   There is a precious service of Christ for the assembly, He "delivered himself up for it"; that is the great underlying fact; His <b>love</b> has gone to the extreme point.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#73:1">Page 73</a>   It is a beautiful illustration of it, six months with oil of myrrh speaking of all the fragrance of His suffering <b>love</b>, then six months with spices; and then it is suggested that something depends on her own exercise in desiring things, because whatever she desired was given her.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#74:1">Page 74</a>   But it is all looked at as the service of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#76:12">Page 76</a>   It was on my heart that we might consider a little the <b>love</b> of Christ to the assembly as His wife, and that we might see the measure and character of that <b>love</b> and what it has in view.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#77:5">Page 77</a>   And Christ is serving the assembly in His unlimited <b>love</b> with a view to a complete result.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#77:6">Page 77</a>   The thought of perfection is being reached in the object of His <b>love</b> -- she is to be completely satisfactory to His own heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#77:25">Page 77</a>   It is the unreserved devotion of His <b>love</b> and His thoughts and service toward us at this moment are according to the <b>love</b> in which He delivered Himself up for us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#79:3">Page 79</a>   Now I think the Lord would exercise us as to whether we have really apprehended the thought of His <b>love</b> to secure a mature result morally now so that we fill the place of wife in a way that is completely satisfactory to the heart of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#79:22">Page 79</a>   It was a complete dedication of Himself in the self-sacrifice of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#80:22">Page 80</a>   That is very beautiful and it helps very much because that is the <b>love</b> of complacency.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#81:15">Page 81</a>   Now if that man is ended and all that is of God is brought in and brought to bear upon our souls by the <b>love</b> of Christ, it is a complete cleansing.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#81:16">Page 81</a>   It is what is entirely new, it is Christ and the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#81:18">Page 81</a>   The washing is by the introduction of something altogether and divinely new and perfect and it sets aside by its power, when applied by the <b>love</b> of Christ to the soul, everything that was there before, and elements come in in which Christ can delight, which become suitable for presentation to Himself<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#82:6">Page 82</a>   That is a very important and necessary question, because the feet-washing shows how the <b>love</b> of Christ considers us in our present position in a scene of defilement.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#82:8">Page 82</a>   Now the Lord considers for the saints, so that we may not be hindered from enjoying this complete purification which His <b>love</b> has brought in.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#82:20">Page 82</a>   We have known what it was to be affected by the circumstances we have passed through having lost the sense of entire suitability, but as we come to a meeting there is a cleansing process which bears witness to us of the <b>love</b> of Christ<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#83:5">Page 83</a>   Think of that passing in cleansing power over our souls by the <b>love</b> of Christ!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#83:19">Page 83</a>   Now that is the character of food which the Lord would in His <b>love</b> make a great reality to us<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#84:7">Page 84</a>   Now the <b>love</b> of Christ would bring the nourishing power of the Father's words unto His wife to nourish her, that she might be nourished and strengthened and fortified by all that which is the joy of His own heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#85:6">Page 85</a>   Remember, we are talking about holy persons now, who correspond with Christ, who can do as He did and who can <b>love</b> as He did and be hated as He was.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#85:19">Page 85</a>  He is carrying on no warfare, He is giving His undivided attention in <b>love</b> to the assembly<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#86:2">Page 86</a>   That is, by the manifestation of His <b>love</b> He cherishes the proper affections of the assembly as His wife.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#86:3">Page 86</a>   He knows how to express His <b>love</b> so that He can call upon them in  John 15  to <b>love</b> one another as He had loved them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#86:4">Page 86</a>   That is, He appeals to the experience they had had of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#86:5">Page 86</a>   Now it is a poor thing if the Lord cannot appeal to some experience of His <b>love</b> in our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#86:6">Page 86</a>   We do not know much of the place of the wife if He cannot appeal to an experience of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#86:8">Page 86</a>   They had experienced it in the feet-washing and therefore I think it is a serving <b>love</b>, <b>love</b> to the brethren that would serve them at personal cost.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#86:10">Page 86</a>   But in chapter 15 it is complacent <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#86:11">Page 86</a>   What a wonderful thing to hear Him say that the Father's <b>love</b> to Him was the measure and character of His <b>love</b> to them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#86:13">Page 86</a>   Now, He says, "<b>Love</b> one another, as I have loved you".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#87:1">Page 87</a>   He can commit them to the Father as those whom He had guarded and carried through in the fidelity of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#87:4">Page 87</a>   The <b>love</b> of Christ is not a sovereign <b>love</b>, it is a discriminating <b>love</b> and a selective <b>love</b>, a <b>love</b> that loves what is lovable.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#88:8">Page 88</a>   Thus the assembly, entering into the <b>love</b> of Christ, is sanctified and cleansed from everything unsuited to that <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#88:15">Page 88</a>   The <b>love</b> of Christ will not suffer anything to remain that is unsuited to itself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#88:16">Page 88</a>   He does not shut His eyes to the spots and wrinkles and blemishes, but His <b>love</b> sets itself to remove them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#89:2">Page 89</a>  If we come together and find it blessed to contemplate the <b>love</b> in which Christ went into death for the assembly, how can we return to the allowance, even in thought or motive, of that which is unsuitable to Christ -- that for which He died?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#90:5">Page 90</a>   On the part of Adam there was not any self-devotion in <b>love</b> nor any intelligent service of <b>love</b> towards Eve.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#91:4">Page 91</a>   Chapter 4 teaches that the body derives from Him: "Holding the truth in <b>love</b>, we may grow up to him in all things, who is the head, the Christ: from whom the whole body, fitted together, and connected by every joint of supply, according to the working in its measure of each one part, works for itself the increase of the body to its self-building up in <b>love</b>" (verses 15 - 17).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#91:6">Page 91</a>   She is for Him in the sense that He is free to carry on all the service of His <b>love</b> towards her, so that in result she may be everything that His heart desires for its complete satisfaction.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#91:13">Page 91</a>   It is the thought of the service of His <b>love</b> towards her, and what she becomes for His satisfaction.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#92:7">Page 92</a>   In the intelligent action of His <b>love</b> He gave Himself entirely over to whatever might be involved in what He had undertaken to bring about.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#92:13">Page 92</a>   If you think of the Lord's death as the supreme service of His <b>love</b>, which it was, there is the type there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#92:16">Page 92</a>   Whatever was involved in, or necessitated by that path of <b>love</b> on which He had entered, He delivered Himself up.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#92:17">Page 92</a>   It brings out the amazing value of what He devoted in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#92:25">Page 92</a>   The adequate answer is that He gets the assembly and has the joy of serving it in <b>love</b> until it becomes the perfect reflex of every thought of beauty that is in His own heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#94:4">Page 94</a>   The result of Christ shining upon us is that we come under the influence of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#94:6">Page 94</a>   She is formed under the influence of the <b>love</b> of the heavenly Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#94:19">Page 94</a>   Well, she is presented as being in view of the mind and heart of Christ; all that the assembly was to be for His satisfaction was present to His heart and mind, so that in His <b>love</b> He devoted Himself for her<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#95:10">Page 95</a>   This precious section is full of the activity of the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#95:11">Page 95</a>   We are told that Christ is Head of the assembly and that she is subjected to Him, and after that all is His activity in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#95:13">Page 95</a>   Is it the <b>love</b> of Christ that has brought that subjection about?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#95:16">Page 95</a>   Yes, and the work of God prepares us to be influenced by the <b>love</b> of Christ, by the warmth of it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#95:18">Page 95</a>   The heat speaks of the <b>love</b> of Christ, but none of us would have been influenced by the <b>love</b> of Christ apart from the work of God; the work of God makes us impressionable to the <b>love</b> of Christ and then we come into the place of being subjected to Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#95:19">Page 95</a>   The assembly is subjected to Christ; she is not merely to be obedient to Him, but to be the subject of the service of His <b>love</b>, for what we find here is that He does everything.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#95:22">Page 95</a>   Is the thought of sanctifying and purifying the present activity of His <b>love</b>?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#95:26">Page 95</a>   It is most important that, through the work of God, she should be subject to the service of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#96:16">Page 96</a>   Well, I think the divine thought is that it finishes before the assembly is translated, because the point is that the assembly as the fruit of the service of <b>love</b> and the purifying of <b>love</b> becomes all that He wants her to be before she is translated.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#96:19">Page 96</a>   Christ serves her in <b>love</b> so that the assembly may have this character of holiness and blamelessness and everything that answers to His pleasure before she is translated.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#97:10">Page 97</a>   I believe there has been a great disregard of the <b>love</b> of Christ in regard of that.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#97:19">Page 97</a>   So that it is not merely that a brother gives a word, but there is something which we can recognise as from the Head, Christ's service of <b>love</b> bringing the purifying influence of the delivering up of Christ, and all its import in purifying power to our affections<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#98:8">Page 98</a>   There is no time more favourable for the service of Christ as Head in <b>love</b> than the meeting for the breaking of bread.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#99:13">Page 99</a>   The feature of subjection makes room for all His service of <b>love</b> and its results, and Paul's adding, "He is Saviour of the body", shows how practical it all is.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#100:3">Page 100</a>   If we want His support, we must see to it that our bodies are vessels of subjection, then the precious service of the <b>love</b> of Christ can go on.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#100:6">Page 100</a>   He loves, He delivers Himself up, He sanctifies, He purifies, He presents, He nourishes and cherishes; it is all the service of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#100:7">Page 100</a>   That is Headship: we get His universal Headship in chapter 1, His Headship of the body in chapter 4 and derivation of everything from Him, and now we get His Headship of the assembly, an intelligent company marked by subjection, a company that is subject to Christ for His service in <b>love</b> to bring the most precious and divine influences to bear upon them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#102:3">Page 102</a>   The service of His <b>love</b> which is active to secure that end is going on, and I think it is essential to the passage to see that the whole subject of it is the devotion of Christ and the service of His <b>love</b>, which does not come out either in Adam or Isaac.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#102:6">Page 102</a>   What we have here is the action of Christ in the devotion of His <b>love</b>, though, of course, we well know that whatever He does, He does by the Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#102:14">Page 102</a>   The translation of the assembly will be an act of power, but what is presented to us here is Christ's service of <b>love</b> and certain things effectuated by that service.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#103:2">Page 103</a>   When would it be proper to say that the Lord began to <b>love</b> the assembly?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#103:25">Page 103</a>   The Lord says, "If ye were of the world, the world would <b>love</b> its own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on account of this the world hates you<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#104:22">Page 104</a>   "As the Father has loved me" -- what a <b>love</b> of infinite complacency!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#104:23">Page 104</a>   There was everything in the Son that was complacent to the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#104:24">Page 104</a>   Now, He says, that is the way I <b>love</b> you.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#104:25">Page 104</a>   It was a <b>love</b> of complacency because there was spiritual substance there in which He could be complacent<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#105:1">Page 105</a>   I believe that gives the idea of the <b>love</b> of Christ for the assembly; it is not a sovereign <b>love</b>; it is a complacent <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#105:22">Page 105</a>   I believe that gives us a spiritual view of the <b>love</b> of Christ for the assembly<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#106:15">Page 106</a>   There is the thought of a purifying and cleansing service in  John 13  and 15, and it is all part of the active service of the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#106:18">Page 106</a>   The wonderful nourishing and cherishing of the <b>love</b> of Christ!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#106:20">Page 106</a>   What we have here is the service of His <b>love</b>; that is what the Spirit of God would engage us with and it is well to ponder these chapters in John as showing both the nourishing and the cherishing of the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#108:9">Page 108</a>   Just take all that the Lord says about His own <b>love</b> for His own, and the Father's <b>love</b>, and the mutual <b>love</b> of the saints among themselves, and you have something of the reality of Christ cherishing His own flesh.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#108:10">Page 108</a>   He gives the warmth and comfort of divine <b>love</b>; it is all very beautiful.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#109:6">Page 109</a>   There was substance there, that which was in substance His own flesh, and He loved it and devoted Himself in <b>love</b> to it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#134:11">Page 134</a>   In  2 Timothy 2:22  it speaks of pursuing righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#136:3">Page 136</a>   It is on the principle of what God proposes in His <b>love</b> to give.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#140:22">Page 140</a>   Perhaps at one time we are more on the line of spiritual sacrifices, that is more the Supper; the holiest is where you have liberty to go as in the <b>love</b> of the new covenant, but we may go that far and not have access to the Father.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#142:2">Page 142</a>      Thy glory now at God's right hand above,  Supreme of all in that blest scene of <b>love</b>,  In sonship tells that heart its wondrous place  In Thee accepted by the Father's grace.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#142:3">Page 142</a>      Thy fulness, Lord, of light and <b>love</b> divine,  No thought can grasp, or human mind define;  The whole vast scene of glory will display  That fulness in a quickly coming day.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#142:4">Page 142</a>      When all things filled by Thee are wholly blest,  And God's deep <b>love</b> eternally shall rest  In that which ever speaks to Him of Thee,  Thy greatness, Lord, the universe shall see.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac26.htm#142:6">Page 142</a>      Thy beauties, Lord, Thy holy, precious worth,  Surpassing far the fairest joys of earth,  Shall then absorb its true and constant <b>love</b>,  Thyself its Object in those scenes above.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#9:3">Page 9</a>   It is very striking as it was a remnant time but these two had a thought of the thousands of them that <b>love</b> God and of the Lord who shall "come amidst his holy myriads".<br>

<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#32:16">Page 32</a>   It would enable us to speak more directly to God of what He is as known in <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#34:11">Page 34</a>   So that He builds a house where He can dwell in the affectionate praises of those who not only <b>love</b> Him, but have sons' intelligence and maturity.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#40:11">Page 40</a>   But after that the kindness and <b>love</b> of God our Saviour toward man appeared, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us",  Titus 3:3  - 5<br>

<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#49:6">Page 49</a>   This is really what is to touch our hearts and fill them with that expectancy of <b>love</b> that regards the Lord's coming with supreme anticipation of pleasure.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#49:9">Page 49</a>   It is the consciousness of the immediate support and <b>love</b> of the heart of Christ and the place we have eternally in our Father's heart and purpose that is our proper start: if we are to continue and to finish well we must make this beginning.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#50:1">Page 50</a>   The Lord does not forget our work of faith and labour of <b>love</b>, and if He has enlarged us and blessed us so that we have been able to minister to Him and to His own, He never forgets it!<br>

<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#109:8">Page 109</a>   The precious stones would, perhaps, set forth the distinctive offices which He fills and the character of <b>love</b> which marks Him as Saviour, Shepherd, Friend, Prophet, Priest, Advocate, King and Head.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#209:7">Page 209</a>   We are all conscious that God has ministered a great deal to us on sovereign lines; He has given us much food in sovereign <b>love</b> and mercy; but He looks now that we should take up the exercise of the food supply ourselves.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#211:8">Page 211</a>   Hezekiah wrote after he had recovered, "But thou hast in <b>love</b> delivered my soul from the pit of destruction", and, "Jehovah was purposed to save me",  Isaiah 38:17 , 20.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#211:9">Page 211</a>   He learned the <b>love</b> of God at the low point to which he was brought.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#211:10">Page 211</a>   It is terrible to us naturally to realise that death is upon us as before God, but it is just there that the <b>love</b> of God comes into contact with us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#211:12">Page 211</a>   For scarcely for the just man will one die, for perhaps for the good man some one might also dare to die; but God commends his <b>love</b> to us, in that, we being still sinners, Christ has died for us",  Romans 5:6  - 8.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#211:14">Page 211</a>   But here it is that God's <b>love</b> has been expressed in Christ having died for us, and this <b>love</b> is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#212:1">Page 212</a>   The <b>love</b> of God is thus applied to us as the cake of figs was applied to Hezekiah.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#212:2">Page 212</a>   How wonderfully sweet it is to find that Christ has been into death to give expression to the <b>love</b> of God, and this is made a personal reality to each one who has the Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#212:10">Page 212</a>   Those who live by the Spirit in relation to God, as having God's <b>love</b> shed abroad in their hearts by the Spirit, know that it is in death that that <b>love</b> has reached them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#212:21">Page 212</a>   It is as the full weight of this comes on our spirits that we are prepared to appreciate that this dreadful thing, death, has become in the death of Christ the expression to us of the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#212:22">Page 212</a>   And the Holy Spirit delights to apply that <b>love</b> to us by shedding it abroad in our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#212:24">Page 212</a>   It is not simply that we believe that God loves us, but His <b>love</b> is shed abroad in our hearts, and it becomes a power of life there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#212:25">Page 212</a>   We are then amongst "the living" who can praise God for His <b>love</b> known through the death of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#213:13">Page 213</a>   The youngest of us should understand that we come together in assembly first of all to think of the great witness of divine <b>love</b> in the death of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#214:3">Page 214</a>   It is sorrowful to think that any believer could willingly remain away from the Lord's supper, for it is the Lord's own personal appeal of <b>love</b> intended to rally all His own.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#214:12">Page 214</a>   If we have known the pressure of death, and how divine <b>love</b> has reached us there, it is in view of our being free to go up in company with Christ to praise God whom He has made known to us in such a wondrous way.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#215:2">Page 215</a>   We are told in the writing of Hezekiah, "Thou hast in <b>love</b> delivered my soul from the pit of destruction" ( Isaiah 38:17 ) and "Jehovah was purposed to save me" ( Isaiah 38:20 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#215:3">Page 215</a>   I gather from that that the cake of figs was a symbol of the intervention of God in <b>love</b> according to purpose; it was applied to the boil and Hezekiah recovered.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#215:6">Page 215</a>   God intervenes in <b>love</b> according to His purpose.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#215:8">Page 215</a>   It is not a question of meeting the claims of God -- we get that at the mercy-seat -- but it is the <b>love</b> of God in relation to the power of death being efficacious as applied to our souls.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#215:10">Page 215</a>   It is not a question of making atonement for sin but a question of the application of the <b>love</b> of God in the death of Christ to the soul of the believer.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#215:11">Page 215</a>   It is a question here in  2 Kings 20  of the application and that is the point in  Romans 5  where the <b>love</b> of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#215:12">Page 215</a>   The <b>love</b> of God as applied that way is definitely brought in to heal; it is the <b>love</b> of God as made known in the death of Christ and so in  Romans 5  we see in verses 6 to 8 the commendation of God's <b>love</b> by His death<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#216:4">Page 216</a>   Just at that point God gives the application of the <b>love</b> of God to the soul; it is not simply believing that God is <b>love</b> but there is a pouring out of that <b>love</b> into the heart by the Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#216:16">Page 216</a>   It is those who live by the Spirit in relation to God, as having the testimony of God's <b>love</b> in their hearts by the Spirit, that can praise God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#217:2">Page 217</a>   "God commends his <b>love</b> to us, in that, we being still sinners, Christ has died for us",  Romans 5:8 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#217:18">Page 217</a>   Having had the witness of the <b>love</b> of God applied by the Spirit like the cake of figs, it is not difficult to go up in the faith of Christ risen.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#218:1">Page 218</a>   He had the <b>love</b> of God applied to him at the lowest point and now he is able to move upward so that he can speak of going upward to the house of Jehovah on the third day which to us clearly implies that we go up as risen with Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#218:2">Page 218</a>  John presents the thing in keeping with Paul and he says, "Herein as to us has been manifested the <b>love</b> of God .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#218:6">Page 218</a>   That is the <b>love</b> of God applied to us in our sinful condition.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#218:7">Page 218</a>   It is important to see that the <b>love</b> of God comes to us at our worst point; in spite of our being sinners the <b>love</b> of God not only comes out to us but is applied to us by the Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#218:12">Page 218</a>   It is the death of Christ in this peculiarly sweet way which brings the <b>love</b> of God to us, poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#218:15">Page 218</a>   In the drinking of the cup we drink afresh of divine <b>love</b> expressed in the death of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#218:22">Page 218</a>   It is not now a question of atonement but the witness of divine <b>love</b>, the death of Christ as the witness of the <b>love</b> of God to us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#218:23">Page 218</a>   If I am assured by the Spirit of the <b>love</b> of God I am liberated.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#219:2">Page 219</a>   We have to go through the history of this in the assembly each time we come together; we go over it afresh in the loaf and the cup which speak of the Lord's death not on the sacrificial side but on the witness side -- the witness of the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#219:15">Page 219</a>   The youngest of us should feel when we come together that we are first of all to think of the great witness of divine <b>love</b> in the death of Christ; then we move up to the sphere of being risen and associated with Christ; we are going to know what it is to be brethren of the One who has ascended to His Father and our Father, and to His God and our God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#219:18">Page 219</a>   To remain away from the breaking of bread is the greatest insult that can be given to divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#221:6">Page 221</a>   It is important to keep the place of those who are under death and who are only safe as the <b>love</b> of God reaches and blesses us there so that we are free to go on to praise and worship.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#243:22">Page 243</a>   There is the expression in Him of God, in His nature, and in all the purposes of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#256:15">Page 256</a>   God can be perfectly restful where He is known as revealed in Christ and through the death of Christ; and He would link all this with the thought of sonship for He has brought it all in by One who is the Son of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#257:2">Page 257</a>   Solomon represents Christ glorified as the Object of the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#257:4">Page 257</a>   As Man He is in the most intimate enjoyment of the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#259:14">Page 259</a>   Saints living in the <b>love</b> of God might answer today to the houses, resulting in our being very near to each other.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#279:12">Page 279</a>   Those who feel the departure and unfaithfulness which have marked the Christian profession can feed upon Christ as having borne in suffering <b>love</b> even what is due to that unfaithfulness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#285:13">Page 285</a>   And we only do so as we are held by the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#286:14">Page 286</a>   That way is the way of <b>love</b>; it answers to the "gold of Parvaim" with which the house was covered.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#286:15">Page 286</a>   Even <b>love</b> may have its gradations, for the Lord spoke of loving much and loving little.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#287:1">Page 287</a>   God would have spirituality of the highest degree, <b>love</b> of the most surpassing excellence, to mark His saints as composing His house.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#287:6">Page 287</a>   As having to do with "the most holy place" holiness and <b>love</b> are required in large measure.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#287:15">Page 287</a>   The epistle to the Ephesians shews how God would have His saints held together in relation to the most holy thoughts of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#289:3">Page 289</a>   We can only go in on the ground that all connected with ourselves as in the flesh has been ended in His death, and that where we were ended the <b>love</b> of God was revealed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#289:4">Page 289</a>  In the knowledge of God revealed in <b>love</b> there is "the new and living way" by which we have "boldness for entering into the holy of holies by the blood of Jesus",  Hebrews 10:19 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#293:1">Page 293</a>   The altar, as known by us today, is very great, for it witnesses that divine <b>love</b> has been expressed in a sacrificial way, and this forms the basis of all our relations with God in His house.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#293:3">Page 293</a>   There is something peculiarly touching in the <b>love</b> of divine Persons as expressed sacrificially because it has acted towards us who have had a sinful history here.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#293:4">Page 293</a>   The <b>love</b> of God as shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit is a sacrificial <b>love</b>: "For we being still without strength, in the due time Christ has died for the ungodly" ( Romans 5:6 ), "But God commends his <b>love</b> to us, in that, we being still sinners, Christ has died for us" ( Romans 5:8 ), "He who, yea, has not spared his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him grant us all things?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#293:5">Page 293</a>  " ( Romans 8:32 ), "The Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me" ( Galatians 2:20 ), "For the <b>love</b> of the Christ constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died; and he died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised" ( 2 Corinthians 5:14 , 15) and "The Christ loved us and delivered himself up for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour" ( Ephesians 5:2 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#293:6">Page 293</a>  There are aspects of the <b>love</b> of divine Persons which are not sacrificial: for example, God's electing <b>love</b> which chose us in Christ before the world's foundation, and the <b>love</b> which gave us the place of children and sons<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#294:1">Page 294</a>   Then Christ chose us out of the world in His <b>love</b>, and called us, and He loves His own as given to Him by the Father.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#294:2">Page 294</a>   The Spirit in the book of Kings had in mind those aspects of divine <b>love</b> which are not sacrificial, for the altar is not mentioned in the description of the house there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#294:9">Page 294</a>   The Lord's supper has its place in that connection, and its having been restored in these last days to its place in the assembly has led to a much deeper appreciation of divine <b>love</b> as expressed sacrificially.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#294:10">Page 294</a>   The loaf and the cup speak of the <b>love</b> of Christ and of the <b>love</b> of God as expressed sacrificially, that is, in a way that involved sacrifice on the part of Christ and of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#296:11">Page 296</a>   It is not a matter of legal requirement, but of suitability to God on the part of those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#296:13">Page 296</a>   As seeing it to be the provision of divine <b>love</b> our hearts should be alert to get the full benefit of it, so that we may be personally suitable for priestly service.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#301:14">Page 301</a>   It is the bringing back to Him of the thoughts of His own <b>love</b> by hearts that have been divinely taught to know and appreciate and respond to them in the Spirit of sonship.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#303:8">Page 303</a>   The moment is reached typically when priesthood ceases to function and the glory intimates that God is there in the supreme satisfaction of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#303:9">Page 303</a>   God's will is <b>love</b> and He is determined to have His own way and to have a universe dominated by the will of God; and all that is going to fill that universe is a living reality to the saints at this moment.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#305:4">Page 305</a>   Coming into manhood He brought in the will of God, not in demand, but by securing the satisfaction of His will in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#305:13">Page 305</a>   "That we should be holy and blameless before him in <b>love</b>; having marked us out beforehand for adoption through Jesus Christ to himself".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#305:16">Page 305</a>   The ten commandments are the necessary claim of <b>love</b>, and now the truth is clear; we find it is in the will of God to satisfy His own <b>love</b>, and what He purposed before the world was to have a vast company before Him holy and without blame, in <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#306:2">Page 306</a>   "The <b>love</b> of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord" -- that gives us the ark.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#306:10">Page 306</a>   "Holy and blameless before him in <b>love</b>" (it is not what they ought to be, but what God's will is that they should be), "marked .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#306:21">Page 306</a>   That is, we get an inner circle first, upon which the will of God has put a most blessed impress; "holy and blameless before him in <b>love</b>", and "marked .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#309:7">Page 309</a>   Dedicated things are wealth added to the house by the devotedness of God's people; they are a permanent witness that His people <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#314:12">Page 314</a>   There can be no further movement beyond this; it brings us to the permanent resting-place of divine <b>love</b>; we touch what is eternal.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#315:12">Page 315</a>   "Glory" is the fruition of His purpose of <b>love</b>, and in order to bring it about He has made perfect the Leader of our salvation through sufferings.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#318:10">Page 318</a>   He purposed in Christ before the world's foundation that a vast company should be holy and without blame before Him in <b>love</b>, marked out for sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, "to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has taken us into favour in the Beloved".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#319:4">Page 319</a>  Then God has not only given us a most holy place before Him, and a relationship in <b>love</b> which answers to His pleasure in a supreme way, but as in that place of sonship and favour He has made known to us the mystery of His will.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#324:13">Page 324</a>   The opened heaven, the descending Spirit, the Father's voice unite to proclaim Him as the object of God's delight and <b>love</b>, and the place of God's rest.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#329:5">Page 329</a>   I refer to the infinitely perfect affections of the heart of that blessed One, the obedience and <b>love</b> in which He was there, the devotedness of the holy Victim which made every part of that unspeakable self-sacrifice a sweet-smelling savour to God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#329:7">Page 329</a>   "That the world may know that I <b>love</b> the Father, and as the Father has commanded me, thus I do.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#329:10">Page 329</a>   Never again can the Son so express His <b>love</b> to the Father as it was expressed at the cross when He gave Himself to maintain the divine glory in respect of sin.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#329:11">Page 329</a>   Well may He speak of that death as a motive for the Father's <b>love</b> to Him, for never were His perfections of obedience and <b>love</b> so wondrously displayed before.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#331:9">Page 331</a>   The greatness of God's <b>love</b>, and of His gracious purposes, is expressed in the greatness and glory of the Person who administers it all to us from God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#332:1">Page 332</a>   She heard of the fame of the one who was set on Jehovah's throne to administer everything for God to the objects of His <b>love</b>, and nothing would satisfy her heart but, as coming to that glorious person, that she might see in his presence the reality of that greatness of which she had heard in her own land.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#334:10">Page 334</a>   Conditions have now come about, through the great and blessed activities of divine <b>love</b>, which make it possible for God to be known by men, and for Him to dwell where He is known.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#335:3">Page 335</a>   His name has been made known by His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, and it expresses all that He is in grace for men, notwithstanding their sinful condition, and it also makes known what He is in the purpose of His <b>love</b> for those whom He has chosen in Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#350:3">Page 350</a>   Indeed, the whole system of eternal glory and the place men are to have in it is of God, and is the outcome of His unmerited favour and sovereign <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#352:10">Page 352</a>   But if He meets the ruined creature in such wondrous grace and <b>love</b> it is because He has in mind to set him up in a new way that is according to His own heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#353:3">Page 353</a>   The Spirit not only sheds God's <b>love</b> abroad in our hearts -- this answers to the kiss -- but He is the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus; we are "come to life again" in Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#353:7">Page 353</a>   God has received us in the fulness of His <b>love</b> as in another Man, and has given us His Spirit that we may be conscious of this, and not regard ourselves any more as in the flesh.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#353:9">Page 353</a>   It is a question of what God has been pleased to do to glorify Himself and to satisfy His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#354:15">Page 354</a>   He has caused the fulness of His grace to shine and the glory of His <b>love</b>.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#369:17">Page 369</a>   It is given to us, through infinite grace and <b>love</b>, to enter into the divine reality in the power of the Holy Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#371:19">Page 371</a>   To be able to minister to the joy of Christ is a wondrous privilege, and divine <b>love</b> has placed even this within our reach.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac27.htm#397:14">Page 397</a>   Our only hope as sinners is that God has rights and He has set them forth in His Son; they are rights of infinite mercy and grace and <b>love</b>.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#3:6">Page 3</a>   At the present time Christ is only known to faith and <b>love</b>, and it is in the faith and <b>love</b> of His people that He is, so to speak, preserved.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#30:7">Page 30</a>   Those who set their <b>love</b> upon God do not need to put Him to the test as to what He will do for them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#32:10">Page 32</a>   Adam and Eve had not the slightest idea He would come in in blessing but He came in blessing really in the sovereignty of His <b>love</b>, in spite of all that they were.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#44:14">Page 44</a>   The new husband gives His company and support and the sense of His <b>love</b> and so is the more endeared to us as we lean upon Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#51:18">Page 51</a>   It is like the considerations of <b>love</b> in  1 Corinthians 13 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#58:7">Page 58</a>   That is, it is the immense claim of such a <b>love</b> by such a Person.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#60:1">Page 60</a>   It entails subjection to divine authority in Him -- of grace and <b>love</b> but still authority.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#83:36">Page 83</a>   God has received us in the fulness of His <b>love</b> in giving us the Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#97:25">Page 97</a>    Colossians 1:11  - 13 links on because it connects sonship with the kingdom; it is "the kingdom of the Son of his <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#97:26">Page 97</a>   It links with Solomon, the Son of the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#105:23">Page 105</a>    Romans 8  contemplates many things that may possibly come upon us, but it comforts us by telling us that Christ is at the right hand of God, and intercedes for us, and that none of the things down here can separate us from the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#105:24">Page 105</a>   It is a fixed constancy in that <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#107:10">Page 107</a>   His commandment is the pleasure of His <b>love</b> in regard to His saints; it is what pleases Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#107:15">Page 107</a>   Though an impossibility to nature, it was possible to <b>love</b>, and what is possible we have to learn from the Lord's own words.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#107:24">Page 107</a>   I suppose we get impressions from the Lord, and we have desires to move spiritually, but we have to learn we cannot sustain ourselves in a position into which in faith and <b>love</b> we have brought ourselves; we have to be dependent on Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#108:8">Page 108</a>   The Lord has very often to let us down; we propose a thing, and though in faith and <b>love</b>, cannot carry it through.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#108:15">Page 108</a>   The first thoughts of <b>love</b> are generally right, but then the test comes in, the wind was there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#111:11">Page 111</a>   If they had been near the Lord they would <b>love</b> His commandments.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#114:17">Page 114</a>   The knowledge of God revealed in <b>love</b> is the spring now.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#114:20">Page 114</a>   Normally, it is occupied with the revelation of God in <b>love</b> and grace in His Son and they become the spring of conduct.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#117:17">Page 117</a>   If I have 'twice ten thousand sins' I have come to the blessed God and I find that He loves me, and His <b>love</b> is expressed in forgiveness; it is what is in His heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#140:16">Page 140</a>   We little take in how available He is in the <b>love</b> in which He gave Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#143:12">Page 143</a>   The only importance of a little child is that it is the subject of <b>love</b>, and the kingdom of the heavens is made up of people like that who are content to have, as their only distinction, that they are the subjects of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#143:13">Page 143</a>   The only importance really that attaches to me is that I am a subject of the <b>love</b> of God and of the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#148:6">Page 148</a>   Some will say they <b>love</b> God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#148:9">Page 148</a>   Man must admit that he does not <b>love</b> his neighbour as himself; they all felt it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#163:26">Page 163</a>   Those who <b>love</b> Him and desire to be faithful to Him are brought to light at the presentation of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#169:1">Page 169</a>   Not only does the Son of man <b>love</b> man, but there is something more wonderful than that, He can make man <b>love</b> Him!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#169:17">Page 169</a>   It is not quite a matter of faith, it is something greater, that is, <b>love</b>; I think <b>love</b> appreciates the headship of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#169:18">Page 169</a>   It is a relationship of affection, and it is <b>love</b> that claims Him in that character.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#169:26">Page 169</a>   It shows we cannot be deprived of that privilege even when in an unsympathetic atmosphere and how <b>love</b> triumphs!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#170:3">Page 170</a>   He was going to be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights; she had measured, so to speak, the length to which His <b>love</b> would go.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#172:10">Page 172</a>   I feel sure if we pondered more the Lord's sufferings and death we should more ardently <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#172:18">Page 172</a>   His <b>love</b>, His perfection, all His supreme excellence came out there in a way never to be repeated.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#173:3">Page 173</a>   It is His death, and we call Him to mind in the light of the unspeakable <b>love</b> in which He went into death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#173:6">Page 173</a>   It is <b>love</b> in suffering which gives a poignancy to it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#173:9">Page 173</a>   Yes, and the <b>love</b> of God comes out in it, because the <b>love</b> of God shed abroad in our hearts is the <b>love</b> in which Christ died for us; and it is the great power of <b>love</b>, the volume of <b>love</b>, that God sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#176:5">Page 176</a>   That is, Judas had been admitted to three-and-a-half years of close intimacy with Christ; he worked miracles and received apostleship, yet, there was not one spark of <b>love</b> in his heart for the Saviour who was about to die for him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#186:3">Page 186</a>   You get the Spirit resting upon Him, God's <b>love</b> and delight resting upon a Man to whom heaven can be opened.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#187:3">Page 187</a>   There is a Man suited to the <b>love</b> and favour of God; that is the Man we have come to.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#187:16">Page 187</a>   There is a glorious Man there who is the Object of God's delight and <b>love</b> and everything is under the influence of that Man and we get the liberty of that place.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#193:27">Page 193</a>   He could say, "I <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#194:8">Page 194</a>   We are brought in, in companionship with the Son, to the circle of God's own <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#194:9">Page 194</a>   First we are companions with the Son in rest, then with Him in the affections and <b>love</b> that fill the Father's house.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#195:5">Page 195</a>  Now having that rest in His own soul it is so touching to see how He turns round to those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#196:3">Page 196</a>   I only know one crucible in which all the naughty pride of our hearts can be melted and that is the crucible of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#196:5">Page 196</a>   If you are content to be a nobody in this world, you can be a companion of Christ in the circle of the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#196:8">Page 196</a>   It was to have a few babes to whom the secrets of the Father's <b>love</b> could be made known.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#198:18">Page 198</a>   The death of the Son of God is the mighty voice of divine <b>love</b> to man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#198:19">Page 198</a>   The ruin, need, guilt and condemnation of man, the sinner, only serve as the dark background to show in stronger light the <b>love</b> that would reach him and bless him in spite of it all<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#204:10">Page 204</a>   But there are hearts that thrill with joy in the sense of His blessedness and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#204:13">Page 204</a>   It is infinitely better to be the smallest, feeblest babe, to perceive the greatness and glory and <b>love</b> of Christ than to be the most honoured person in the world without any appreciation of Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#205:8">Page 205</a>   Brought into His life and into His relationship, to have part with Him in the Father's <b>love</b>, sons with Him who is "the firstborn among many brethren", His assembly shares His place and glory as the risen and exalted Man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#208:9">Page 208</a>   He has brought out the Father's glory and He is the object of the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#208:10">Page 208</a>   How the consideration of this takes us outside the circle of our need and carries us into the circle of the Father's <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#208:12">Page 208</a>   And I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known; that the <b>love</b> with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them",  John 17:25 , 26.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#208:14">Page 208</a>   If the Father's <b>love</b>, and Christ the blessed Object of that <b>love</b>, are in us we are morally qualified for the service of God in His sanctuary.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#209:6">Page 209</a>   His singing is the suited and divine response to the Father's name and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#209:18">Page 209</a>   He has not only manifested His <b>love</b> in the gift of His beloved Son but He has given the Holy Spirit as the powerful witness of His <b>love</b> in our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#209:19">Page 209</a>   We are assured by a divine witness of the efficacy of Christ's work, and of the unspeakable <b>love</b> of God as the source of all our blessing<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#210:1">Page 210</a>   There is not a cloud on the <b>love</b> of God, or a spot on our consciences to keep us from enjoying it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#210:4">Page 210</a>    The revelation of God  has come out in the death of His Son, who came into death, not only to banish every cloud and remove every spot, but in order that there might be a way paved with divine <b>love</b> over which our souls might travel adoringly into nearness to God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#210:5">Page 210</a>   It is "the new and living way"; it lives in all the blessedness of divine <b>love</b>, and Christ is the One who has opened it up.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#210:6">Page 210</a>   He had to remove in holy judgment all that we were, but in the very place where He did so He disclosed the depths of the heart of God, that we might live in the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#210:8">Page 210</a>   He is the great centre and power of attraction by which those who <b>love</b> Him are withdrawn from every rival influence and led into the blessed privilege of approach to God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#210:11">Page 210</a>   He leads our hearts into the holy <b>love</b> of God, and into the vast and glorious purposes of that <b>love</b> which find their centre in Himself and their circumference in a universe of bliss filled by Him with the knowledge and praise of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#210:12">Page 210</a>   He thus secures a company in the intelligence of what is in the mind of God, and knowing the <b>love</b> of God, and therefore capable for the service of God in praise and worship.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#211:2">Page 211</a>   God's house is  filled , in the sense that there is a company there capable of entering into His mind and the thoughts of His <b>love</b> -- able to trace adoringly the perfection of His ways in Christ -- and thus able to give Him now the praise and glory that are due to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#212:24">Page 212</a>   There was the wisdom of divine <b>love</b> in the selection of Peter, James and John; they were selected for great spiritual privileges.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#213:18">Page 213</a>   That is the end of the kingdom; it comes in to adjust and correct in view of our passing on to know the Lord as the Son of the Father's <b>love</b> and being in suited companionship with Him in the house.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#216:1">Page 216</a>   Those who <b>love</b> Him keep His commandments.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#216:2">Page 216</a>   The manifestation has certain grounds, obedience and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#216:6">Page 216</a>   and I will <b>love</b> him and will manifest myself to him",  John 14:21 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#217:26">Page 217</a>  Paul speaks of being beside himself, showing that it is possible for a spiritual man to be in God's presence in the thoughts of divine <b>love</b> entirely apart from the question of responsibility; when that is reached it is a moment of ecstasy.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#224:8">Page 224</a>   His is not a cold light; it is the light of <b>love</b>; it is God revealed, not only in His power or His attributes, but in His nature.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#224:9">Page 224</a>   "God is <b>love</b>"; it is what He is essentially and absolutely; and it is His glory that His nature can shine forth in all its blessedness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#224:11">Page 224</a>   All the subjects of the Father's purpose are being brought under the shining of Christ into the warmth of the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#225:18">Page 225</a>   How fragrant was that suffering <b>love</b> in which He went through the sorrows and the darkness of the cross, so that the lawlessness which He hated might be removed and the righteousness which He loved might be established, and so that ultimately all His redeemed ones might have garments like His own.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#228:15">Page 228</a>   We live in seeing Him, and it is characteristic of the whole of the present period, while the world sees Him no longer, that He comes to those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#229:3">Page 229</a>   He came to them in the <b>love</b> of which His death was the witness -- the <b>love</b>, too, which gave them a place of association with Him in the presence of His Father and God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#229:4">Page 229</a>   And in this same <b>love</b> He still comes to His own.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#229:9">Page 229</a>   Then, again, we see in Him, glorified as the risen One, the perfect setting forth of all God's thoughts and the purpose of His <b>love</b> in regard to man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#229:16">Page 229</a>   He has received the assembly as the Father's <b>love</b>-gift to Him, and it is the subject of His self-sacrificing <b>love</b>, and of His present care and profound interest, as it will be His supreme joy and peculiar treasure -- His companion and bride -- in scenes of glory.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#229:17">Page 229</a>   Now He is coming to us that we may see Him in all these varied and blessed perfections of His glory and <b>love</b>, that we may see Him, the living One, and live because He lives<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#230:4">Page 230</a>   It is rather eyes being opened to see the kingdom of God, to see the light of God in His beloved Son, and the thirst of the heart quenched by drinking the knowledge of divine Persons and divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#230:12">Page 230</a>   He comes to us to satisfy us with His own presence and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#230:13">Page 230</a>   It is not to be supposed that the failure and ruin of the assemblies has stayed this activity of Christ's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#230:15">Page 230</a>   Yet even there, true to His own word and to His own <b>love</b>, He comes.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#231:8">Page 231</a>   A true note of praise to the Father, a true response to the <b>love</b> and blessing in which He has made Himself known, is a wondrous and holy thing.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#232:5">Page 232</a>  Son of God, with joy we view Thee  Of God's <b>love</b> the object meet;  While, Lord Jesus Christ, 'tis through Thee  All our blessing is complete.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#237:13">Page 237</a>   He is a righteous Master and will pay His servants for all they do, but we are speaking today of something more important to those who <b>love</b> Him than wages.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#238:5">Page 238</a>   But the grace of our Lord surpassingly overabounded with faith and <b>love</b>, which is in Christ Jesus", 1 Timothy l: 12  - 14.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#242:9">Page 242</a>   The best robe is given to the prodigal that he may be perfectly suited to God, and free to enjoy the <b>love</b> of God in the circle to which <b>love</b> brings him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#249:16">Page 249</a>   There can be no true knowledge of God in <b>love</b>, or grace, or mercy, save as we recognise the necessity for sin being judged, and this, I believe, is set forth in the symbolical language, "gold purified by fire".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#250:1">Page 250</a>   The <b>love</b> of God is only known when it is seen that He gave His Son to bear the judgment of sin.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#252:2">Page 252</a>   Man in the Person of Christ is now in righteousness with God, beyond sin, beyond death, beyond the reach of Satan's power, the object of God's complacency and delight, made full of joy by God's countenance, holy and without blame before Him in <b>love</b>, accepted and beloved in the relationship and dignity of sonship.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#256:16">Page 256</a>   May none of us miss the opportunity, which is at this moment within our reach, of carrying through those transactions with Him to which His <b>love</b> counsels us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#257:6">Page 257</a>   It is His thought that the assembly shall finish as possessed of the best that divine <b>love</b> can furnish.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#263:23">Page 263</a>   The reason the remission of sins comes in is to clear the ground so that we may live in all that is the outcome of the <b>love</b> of God; that is the world in which we live<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#264:5">Page 264</a>   Because the <b>love</b> of God is revealed as the spring and source of everything; first we are brought into the appreciation of Christ, then in seeing that God is the source of all blessing, we are brought to God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#264:10">Page 264</a>   Grace and <b>love</b> and everything is ministered; it is the secret of rest and liberty with God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#264:11">Page 264</a>   The remission of sins comes in because the <b>love</b> of God is expressed in that way; that is how it has come to us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac28.htm#264:19">Page 264</a>   This is the outcome of the blessed <b>love</b> of God, and then there is a final step of divine joy, that of association.<br>
<h3>Volume 29 - An Outline of John's Gospel</h3>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#5:4">Page 5</a>  God has been expressed here in the fullest possible way in His nature and character, and in His thoughts of <b>love</b> towards men.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#9:14">Page 9</a>  It has been said that God suffices for Himself in everything but His <b>love</b>, but because of His <b>love</b> -- what He is in His nature -- He must express Himself so that His intelligent creatures may know and <b>love</b> Him<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#30:9">Page 30</a>  God would bring in life for men in the glorious Person spoken of in  John 1:1  - 3, and it is in the knowledge of God made known in <b>love</b> that we have life.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#30:10">Page 30</a>   If we entered into the thought that God in <b>love</b> had found delight in us, and has eternally planned that we should find most wonderful blessing in the knowledge of Himself as <b>love</b>, that would be life in our souls.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#30:17">Page 30</a>   It is the light of God Himself known as <b>love</b>; everything that He could express of Himself was expressed in His beloved Son and it was expressed in a living way.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#31:13">Page 31</a>   But, before the family thought is introduced we have the basis of it in the knowledge of God in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#31:14">Page 31</a>   If we do not know God in <b>love</b>, we shall not touch the family thought.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#31:15">Page 31</a>   Knowing God in <b>love</b> is the start, and the light of the <b>love</b> of God has come to us in His Son.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#35:5">Page 35</a>   What a Person to know and <b>love</b> and serve!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#43:20">Page 43</a>   Then it is  with God  that we learn His  <b>love</b> , His unmeasured  grace , His glorious  purposes  His great thoughts concerning Christ and the assembly, the reality of the Spirit's power, and many other things which are accepted in theory by many but known as realities by few<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#45:4">Page 45</a>   Whether it be the terror of the Lord, the <b>love</b> of God, the value of Christ's work, or the blessings which faith enjoys, we must ourselves have entered into that which we press upon others or we became  lecturers  rather than  witnesses .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#50:8">Page 50</a>   God has shone out as made known in <b>love</b>, and there is no need now for any man to be in darkness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#50:15">Page 50</a>   He is made known in <b>love</b> through His beloved Son.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#50:17">Page 50</a>   We walk in the light of God made known in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#52:1">Page 52</a>  At the present time God is working in sovereign <b>love</b> so that there may be persons who will receive the light.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#53:18">Page 53</a>   If I have received Christ as the light of God made known in <b>love</b> I am entitled to take the place of one of the children of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#54:12">Page 54</a>   We come together on Lord's day morning because of the intensity of our appreciation of God's blessed Son, and because we <b>love</b> to respond to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#55:18">Page 55</a>  To <b>love</b> darkness rather than light is worse than to be a murderer, thief or drunkard; it is far worse than any immoral conduct because it indicates hatred of God.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#56:1">Page 56</a>   The light is the light of God in <b>love</b>, for those words immediately follow "God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal".<br>

<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#56:5">Page 56</a>   They do not <b>love</b> the light because they want to go on in sin; the secret is that their works are evil; that is they are not wrought in God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#56:11">Page 56</a>   Every one who comes under the sound of the gospel, and does not believe it, is not only despising the grace and <b>love</b> of God, but is setting himself in defiance of the authority of God.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#61:6">Page 61</a>   The Father was drawing them to Christ by giving them a sense of the blessedness of the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#61:17">Page 61</a>   Or do they find us occupied with the ledger, the newspaper or with a thousand things that pertain to this life and to the world, so that -- though we may sometimes sigh in the weariness of our way, and the Spirit of God may occasionally turn our souls heavenward with desire to breathe the atmosphere of divine <b>love</b> in the company of Christ -- it cannot be said that we really "seek" His company at all?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#62:6">Page 62</a>   He will cause those that <b>love</b> Him to "inherit substance" and He will "fill their treasuries"; and He says, "They that seek me early shall find me".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#62:12">Page 62</a>   The glory that attracted the hearts of the two disciples to that Blessed One was a  moral  glory -- a glory of divine perfections and <b>love</b> which only anointed eyes could discern or appreciate -- and the place "where he abode" speaks to our hearts of a moral dwelling-place suited to Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#62:13">Page 62</a>   In a word, the two disciples wanted to know Him  in His own circle , and His <b>love</b> conferred upon them the freedom of that circle.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#63:4">Page 63</a>   It cannot be said that she was strong in  faith  or  hope , but she stands conspicuous for <b>LOVE</b> to His blessed Person.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#63:8">Page 63</a>   And the same voice that had said, "Come and see", opened up to her a new world of everlasting <b>love</b>, and brought her consciously into a new association with Himself outside all the desolation of this scene of death, as by the one word "Mary" He called her into the presence of His unchanged and living <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#64:2">Page 64</a>   His death has ended our history before God as in the flesh, and divested us in the presence of infinite <b>love</b> of every trace of unsuitability to that <b>love</b>.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#65:4">Page 65</a>   This scripture is of great importance because it brings together in one view (1) the first <b>love</b> of the church, (2) the decline of that <b>love</b>, and (3) the awakening and revival thereof so as to make the wise virgins "ready" for the return of the bridegroom.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#65:11">Page 65</a>   This is the great characteristic of first <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#65:14">Page 65</a>   How soon the Lord had to say, "But I have against thee, that thou hast left thy first <b>love</b>",  Revelation 2:4 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#68:6">Page 68</a>   When our hearts are illuminated by His <b>love</b> we are in conscious suitability to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#68:12">Page 68</a>   Paul was conscious of a <b>love</b> which had divested him at its own cost of everything that was unsuited to itself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#68:14">Page 68</a>   He recognised nothing as life to God but Christ living in him; and the One who had thus set him free in the presence of divine <b>love</b> from all that attached to him as a man in the flesh was now the object of his heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#69:1">Page 69</a>   but I cannot improve my wretched self, and I cannot get rid of it', I should like you to consider the infinite <b>love</b> that is here brought before us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#69:2">Page 69</a>   The Son of God has undertaken in <b>love</b> to remove all my unsuitability, and to accomplish this He has given Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#69:8">Page 69</a>   It is a most blessed thing to know Him in His greatness and glory, and to know that there is an eternal link of <b>love</b> between Him and me -- <b>love</b>, which has removed, for its own satisfaction and at its own cost, everything that I am morally as of the race of Adam, so that I might be free in the presence of that <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#69:9">Page 69</a>   The Holy Spirit would illuminate our hearts with the light of this <b>love</b>.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#78:3">Page 78</a>   There is necessity for Him to wear that sacrificial title, for He came to bring the testimony of divine <b>love</b> into DEATH.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#78:5">Page 78</a>   Everyone who is in the light of this blessed fact, that the Son of God has assumed the title of Lamb of God, must be conscious that by His doing so a divine solution of the whole question of sin was absolutely ensured, and this in the way of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#78:8">Page 78</a>   We are in the light of the blessed revelation of Himself; divine <b>love</b> has been presented to us in its supremacy and sovereignty in the fact that He has gone into death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#79:7">Page 79</a>   But at the same time we shall be in the presence of divine <b>love</b> that could go even unto death to remove sin, and to reveal itself to our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#79:9">Page 79</a>   We should follow the Lamb of God through death into His own circle, where there is no trace of sin, where there is nothing to dim the shining of '<b>love</b> supreme and bright'.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#79:11">Page 79</a>   He says, "Come and see"; He would have us to know the place of His abode, and if we miss this we miss the very kernel of christianity -- the crowning privilege and blessing of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#79:12">Page 79</a>   The whole work of grace in our souls, the Father's activity in sovereign <b>love</b>, the drawings of His grace and power, are all with a view to our introduction to this blessed association with His Son<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#81:6">Page 81</a>   One is the great redeeming act of Christ in <b>love</b> to those under curse; He became a curse; the other is the wondrous act of God having in view His purpose that we should become His righteousness in Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#81:7">Page 81</a>   The Son of man as lifted up was publicly seen to be in the place of sin and curse, but it is our peace and joy to know that He was not there on His own account at all, but in divine <b>love</b> on behalf of those who were under sin and death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#81:8">Page 81</a>   His lifting up, as referred to in  John 3:14 , was on God's part as given in <b>love</b>, that eternal life might be brought in and become the portion of those who were under sin and death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#82:5">Page 82</a>   But this testimony comes to men in the way of grace, for the One who has been lifted up in the place of sin was there as the great manifestation of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#82:10">Page 82</a>   The lifting up in chapter 3 is on God's part in <b>love</b>; but in chapter 8 it is what men do, "When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#83:16">Page 83</a>   This is the blessed way which divine <b>love</b> has taken to draw men away from a world fully exposed as having nothing in common with God<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#85:5">Page 85</a>   The condition in which Christ was made sin went out of God's sight in His burial, and this is of immense importance when we consider all its consequences in their bearing on those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#86:3">Page 86</a>   He descended in the strength of His <b>love</b> to the lower parts of the earth; we get the full measure of His descent as we take in the thought of His burial.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#86:6">Page 86</a>   In anointing His body for burial she showed that the full depth of His descent in <b>love</b> was before her heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#88:2">Page 88</a>   The mighty power of God acted in those "lower parts of the earth" into which Christ had descended in <b>love</b>, so that His burial really took Him to the point which would witness to the fullest expression of the might of God's strength.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#88:8">Page 88</a>   <b>Love</b> descended to that point, but the might of God's strength came in to raise Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#88:9">Page 88</a>   The <b>love</b> in which He descended was towards us, and the power that raised Him is towards us also.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#88:10">Page 88</a>   The whole matter had in view God's wondrous purposes of <b>love</b> in regard to us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#89:2">Page 89</a>  A further result of the burial of Christ is its bearing on those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#90:5">Page 90</a>   His <b>love</b> demanded the privilege of identification with Christ in connection with His burial.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#90:9">Page 90</a>   His going down to burial was a movement of <b>love</b> on his part, and it is a movement which we all have to make if we are to know the true meaning of being "buried with him in baptism".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#91:2">Page 91</a>   The Lord went finally out of this world by burial, and His grave is left "hewn in the rock" as a permanent spot for <b>love</b> to occupy, in a spiritual sense, as soon as there is a readiness to do so.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#94:3">Page 94</a>  I wish to speak briefly of three things which are here presented very distinctly, the  purpose  of God for man's blessing, the great  necessity  which came across the divine purpose and had to be met before that purpose could be carried out and the  <b>love</b>  which was behind all -- which formed the purpose and met the necessity.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#159:2">Page 159</a>   The soul may have a long journey to reach it experimentally; there may be many needs and exercises to be met and removed on the way; self and the world may have to be learned; but the great end of all our exercises -- and, I may add, of all our deliverances -- is that we rest in the thoughts of divine <b>love</b>, and that <b>love</b> becomes in a very real way the portion of our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#159:3">Page 159</a>   If our hearts are not in the circle of divine <b>love</b> they have really got  nothing , for as christians we have no portion on earth or in the world; our portion is in divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#159:9">Page 159</a>   As to this world the disciples had lost everything and gained nothing, but to compensate for this they got divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#159:10">Page 159</a>   Many are content to have assurance of pardon and eternal security, without forsaking all to follow a rejected Christ; that is, they have not in heart and spirit broken with the world, and they do not know what it is to have a portion in divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#160:6">Page 160</a>   Jesus came  from God  into a world of sin, of man's ruin, of Satan's triumph, and of God's grief and dishonour; and He has secured everything  for God , so that He could go back  to God  as the One who has removed every hindrance to the full display and triumph of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#160:10">Page 160</a>   Let us seek to enter into what that death was for God, and into the wondrous blessings of divine <b>love</b> for which it opens the way according to the counsel and purpose of the heart of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#160:11">Page 160</a>   The work of Christ is infinitely great in moral grandeur as the everlasting basis on which the purposes of divine <b>love</b> are secured, and it is from this point of view that it is presented to us in John's gospel.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#160:12">Page 160</a>   Let us turn to five scriptures which bring before us some of the things that have been secured for the satisfaction of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#161:5">Page 161</a>   The magnitude and scope of it are beyond us, but surely the feeblest heart will rejoice to know that a world of bliss has been secured for God -- a world where divine <b>love</b> will have eternal satisfaction and rest -- all secured by Jesus, who will be the Centre and Sun of that universe of bliss.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#161:16">Page 161</a>   The Father and the Son wanted the sheep for Themselves, and the death of Christ is the righteous title of divine <b>love</b> to take possession, and to keep possession, of them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#161:17">Page 161</a>   The Father and the Son wanted a company whom They might introduce to the circle of divine <b>love</b>, with a nature suitable to that circle, and capable of appreciating and responding to it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#161:20">Page 161</a>   But the sheep are held on the ground of redemption; they are partakers of the divine nature, and they are secured for the satisfaction of divine <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#162:4">Page 162</a>   If we are left here a little longer we shall need the grace, mercy, and forbearance of God in a thousand ways, but all that will be needed in the future to keep us for the Father and the Son is small compared with the stupendous cost at which divine <b>love</b> secured us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#162:5">Page 162</a>   "Hereby we have known <b>love</b>, because  he  has laid down his life for us",  1 John 3:16 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#162:7">Page 162</a>   In the company secured by divine <b>love</b> there can be no fleshly distinctions.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#163:20">Page 163</a>   The Last Adam came from God, secured everything  for God , and has gone  to God  as the glorified Head of a new race brought into divine <b>love</b> in association with Himself, and Head of a new creation in which all the thoughts of that <b>love</b> will be effected and displayed for ever.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#164:5">Page 164</a>   Those far-reaching realms of light and glory are fitly inherited by Him who has put them all in suitability to divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#164:9">Page 164</a>   the portion of our hearts is  divine <b>love</b> .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#165:12">Page 165</a>   His heart is bound to that company in inconceivable <b>love</b>; it is His peculiar treasure -- the "pearl of great value" to obtain which "he .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#165:16">Page 165</a>   Indeed, the consideration of all that is involved in being "his own" would carry our hearts over the whole range of divine grace, and would lead us in a wonderful way into the thoughts of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#165:20">Page 165</a>   In the thoughts of divine <b>love</b> we are of such value as to be a suitable gift from the Father to the Son -- a gift worthy of the Giver and the Receiver<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#166:1">Page 166</a>   We shall be for ever the expression to the Son of the Father's <b>love</b> to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#166:12">Page 166</a>   He has an indisputable right to us, for He has redeemed us, and in doing so has proved that His <b>love</b> was "strong as death".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#166:14">Page 166</a>   There can never be such an  expression  of His <b>love</b> again, but the  <b>love</b>  that thus expressed itself remains unchanged.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#166:18">Page 166</a>   In perfect contrast to this there was divine <b>love</b>, divine light, and divine lowliness in Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#167:11">Page 167</a>   Nothing can measure this <b>love</b>; no sounding-line can fathom it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#167:12">Page 167</a>   If we had, like Paul, "suffered the loss of all" things here, would not His <b>love</b> be a sufficient compensation?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#167:13">Page 167</a>   Rebecca lost her own country, but she got Isaac's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#167:15">Page 167</a>   But you may depend upon it that Isaac's <b>love</b> was the great thing to Rebecca.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#167:16">Page 167</a>   We are often occupied with our blessings, but the great thing is  the <b>love</b> of Christ .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#167:17">Page 167</a>   And his <b>love</b> never fails.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#167:20">Page 167</a>   It would be a natural thing for such a company to go out of the world, as Jesus was about to do, for "his own" are in the circle of divine <b>love</b>, and there is nothing in the world that answers to that <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#168:1">Page 168</a>   Left in the world, and yet within the circle of divine <b>love</b>; that is, belonging to the very circle into which Jesus has gone.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#168:6">Page 168</a>   It is a circle of heavenly <b>love</b>, but we come within it even here.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#168:9">Page 168</a>   If we were  altogether  in the circle of divine affections, divine <b>love</b> could  rest  in our undisturbed blessing.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#168:11">Page 168</a>   And therefore so long as we are in the world divine <b>love</b> cannot  rest ; that <b>love</b> must needs consider all these contrary and hindering elements, and must  serve  in its solicitude to maintain us in the enjoyment of, and in suitability to, that heavenly circle to which we belong.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#168:13">Page 168</a>  Divine <b>love</b> considers everything -- knows what the world is -- knows what we are -- and loves to the end.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#168:14">Page 168</a>   It is an out-and-out <b>love</b> -- <b>love</b> in spite of everything.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#168:19">Page 168</a>   Nothing can turn that <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#169:2">Page 169</a>   On the other hand, it is as "knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that he came out from God and was going to God", that He rises and girds Himself for His service of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#169:3">Page 169</a>   The greatness and glory of which He was so perfectly conscious give an inexpressible depth of meaning to this unique act of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#169:4">Page 169</a>   Their condition, too, perfectly known by Him, did not stay that <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#169:5">Page 169</a>   He knew that one would deny Him, and all forsake Him -- the treachery of Judas and the weakness of Peter were alike before Him -- but His <b>love</b> retired, if we may so say, into itself, and acted altogether from itself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#169:13">Page 169</a>  I must again remind you of the fact that, although we belong to the circle of divine <b>love</b>, we are still "in the world".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#169:14">Page 169</a>   The Lord is altogether in the circle of divine <b>love</b> -- He has gone to the Father -- and as our hearts enter into that circle we have part with Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#170:1">Page 170</a>   We are entitled to be in the circle of divine <b>love</b>; divine grace has called us into it; and as being partakers of the divine nature we are of that circle; we are of it as belonging to the Father and the Son; and yet it is not less true that the blessed Lord says to each one of us, "Unless I wash thee, thou hast not part with me".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#170:2">Page 170</a>   There is an absolute necessity for this service of <b>love</b> to maintain our hearts in freedom from the influences of the world, and in such superiority to all that is incidental to our present condition, that in heart and spirit we may really enter the circle of divine affections, and have part with Him who has gone to the Father.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#170:13">Page 170</a>   So far from the defilement of  John 13  being actual failure or sin, I believe the most spiritual person is the one who will most appreciate this service of <b>love</b> -- he is the one who will have the deepest sense of the need of having his feet washed<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#173:3">Page 173</a>   It furnishes Him with opportunity to give continual expression to His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#173:4">Page 173</a>   But for this ministry of divine <b>love</b> our contact with the world, and our susceptibility to the influences of this present scene, would have the effect of permanently withdrawing our hearts from  part with Christ  in the circle of divine affections.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#173:6">Page 173</a>   May He be graciously pleased to draw us near to Himself, and give our hearts a deeper sense of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#173:11">Page 173</a>   He brings Himself and His <b>love</b> before our hearts, and thus He displaces the dust of the world.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#173:12">Page 173</a>   It is a distinct service -- the special service of His <b>love</b> while we are in the world.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#173:14">Page 173</a>   No doubt this service of <b>love</b> is for all "his own", but we ought to be exercised as to whether we have been in a condition to get the good of it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#173:15">Page 173</a>   One must be consciously of "his own", and have the world as a judged thing, before he can realize the good of this precious service of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#174:2">Page 174</a>   Do we not often read the Word and pray without turning  to the Lord  for His present and personal ministry of <b>love</b>?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#174:4">Page 174</a>   If we have part with Him we shall <b>love</b> His own, and we shall wash their feet.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#174:5">Page 174</a>   Those who taste the joys of that circle of divine affections cannot help longing that others should have their feet cleansed from the dust of the world, that they might enjoy their true portion according to the thoughts of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#174:8">Page 174</a>   But if my feet have been washed the <b>love</b> of Christ and of the Father are known in my heart -- I am in the circle of divine affections -- and I naturally speak of the things that are in that circle.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#174:13">Page 174</a>   We must know the thoughts of divine <b>love</b> to understand this precious service of Christ; and I shall be thankful if the Lord uses His word tonight to lead us a little more into those thoughts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#175:10">Page 175</a>  We find that there is a clean company amongst whom the service of <b>love</b> is carried on.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#176:4">Page 176</a>   The Lord inaugurates a service of <b>love</b> in a clean company, which is to persist so long as the Lord is absent.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#176:18">Page 176</a>   The Lord says, "<b>Love</b> one another as I have loved you"; it is serving <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#176:19">Page 176</a>   "First <b>love</b>" is to <b>love</b> one another as Christ has loved us, and it was from this that they had got away at Ephesus<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#177:1">Page 177</a>   It is a perpetual service of <b>love</b> until we leave this world altogether.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#177:11">Page 177</a>   If we are set in movement by the service of <b>love</b> the traitor goes out and there are conditions established in which we can come to the Father.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#178:18">Page 178</a>   Not only is He merciful and compassionate, but He comes out in His beloved Son to show that these things are entirely contrary to His mind; there is not a trace of them in His thought, We only know the Father in the conditions in which He has come in the greatness of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#180:8">Page 180</a>  SERVING <b>LOVE</b> AND COMPLACENT <b>LOVE</b> John 13:34 , 35;  John 15:9  - 21 These scriptures give us a true character and meaning of first <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#181:1">Page 181</a>   We have often been told that the point of departure is the point of recovery, and it may be helpful, and an exercise to us, to look at these scriptures as giving the character of first <b>love</b>; that is the <b>love</b> which was set in motion by the Son of God in His own.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#181:4">Page 181</a>   The Lord says to the church in Ephesus, "Thou hast left thy first <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#181:8">Page 181</a>  Perfect <b>love</b> has been seen and known in a Man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#181:9">Page 181</a>   I do not mean exactly the <b>love</b> of God, but divine <b>love</b> in a Man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#181:11">Page 181</a>   Divine <b>love</b> was here livingly in a Man, the Son of God, and He came here in order to make it a living spring in human hearts so that there might be a living witness of Christ and of God in this world, and that is vital christianity.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#181:13">Page 181</a>   No part of that order was merely an arbitrary rule; it was all the expression of the wisdom of divine <b>love</b> for the safeguarding and development of holy affections in the saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#182:4">Page 182</a>   At Ephesus everything on the administrative line was in good order as yet, but the very kernel -- first <b>love</b> -- was gone.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#182:6">Page 182</a>  Is it <b>love</b> to each other or to Him?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#182:8">Page 182</a>   His <b>love</b> is the spring of all, and if we are conscious of that <b>love</b> we <b>love</b> Him and we <b>love</b> one another.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#182:9">Page 182</a>   But He never commands us to <b>love</b> Him; it is "<b>Love</b> one another".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#182:10">Page 182</a>   The Lord made His disciples conscious of His <b>love</b>, and we cannot think of our <b>love</b> as anything but the outcome of the consciousness of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#182:11">Page 182</a>   It comes out in <b>love</b> one to another.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#182:13">Page 182</a>   The point is that <b>love</b> one to another is set going.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#182:14">Page 182</a>   The coming of the Son of God and the subsequent coming of the Spirit were to the end that <b>love</b> might be set in movement and kept in movement in human hearts, and that is vital christianity.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#182:16">Page 182</a>  In  John 13  the Lord thinks of His saints as those who need serving and His <b>love</b> will go down to the lowest point to, serve them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#182:17">Page 182</a>   It is <b>love</b> that never fails.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#182:18">Page 182</a>   That is a character of <b>love</b> we need to apprehend; we are so expectant from others instead of being ready to serve them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#182:19">Page 182</a>   It is in reference to His serving <b>love</b> that the Lord says, "A new commandment I give to you, that ye <b>love</b> one another; as I have loved you, that ye also <b>love</b> one another".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#182:20">Page 182</a>   In chapter 13 it is the <b>love</b> that serves; in chapter 15 it is the <b>love</b> of complacency.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#182:21">Page 182</a>   There he says, "As the Father has loved me, I also have loved you: abide in my <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#182:22">Page 182</a>   That is complacent <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#182:24">Page 182</a>   The company as viewed in chapter 15 is the fruit of divine working; it is morally the fruit of the service of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#182:25">Page 182</a>  If this blessed <b>love</b> that serves lives anywhere now on earth it is in the saints<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#183:3">Page 183</a>   You have not complacent <b>love</b>, perhaps, towards all your brethren, for that demands certain conditions, but serving <b>love</b> can always be active.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#183:8">Page 183</a>   Does it not appeal to us to lay aside all thought of what is due to ourselves that we may by <b>love</b> serve one another?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#183:15">Page 183</a>   In  John 13  <b>love</b> will  serve  to any extent: in  John 15  <b>love</b> will  suffer  to any extent.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#183:16">Page 183</a>   "No one has greater <b>love</b> than this, that one should lay down his life for his friends".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#183:17">Page 183</a>   That is not atonement, it is <b>love</b> suffering.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#183:18">Page 183</a>   Every one of us has a niche to fill in this service of <b>love</b>; we ought all to be exercised as to whether we are on this line.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#183:20">Page 183</a>  Divine <b>love</b> would be ready for any opportunity<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#184:1">Page 184</a>   We are provided with a circle where <b>love</b> can be active; the Lord has provided us with brethren, and every one of them is an opportunity for the service of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#184:6">Page 184</a>   That is <b>love</b> in activity in a Man, a blessed Man, the Son of God, who loves His own to the end, and gives impulse to everything on our side so that everything that is according to God may be set in motion here in men.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#184:19">Page 184</a>   I have often felt rebuked by coming in contact with a man who was in the spirit of service to others in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#185:4">Page 185</a>   We suffer long and get cross at the end, but <b>love</b> suffers long and is kind, kind at the end.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#185:7">Page 185</a>   They keep His commandments; they abide in His <b>love</b>; they are His friends, and they come out here in His moral character.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#185:13">Page 185</a>   His commandment is that we should <b>love</b> one another, and if He sees us doing it He takes account of us as His friends.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#185:14">Page 185</a>   That is why <b>love</b> is the condition of increase of knowledge.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#185:15">Page 185</a>   If we want expansion in spiritual intelligence we shall get it by being united together in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#185:18">Page 185</a>   The service of <b>love</b> and intelligence in communion are as much for sisters as brothers.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#187:5">Page 187</a>   Well, it is a great thing to have such a desire, because it shows that we <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#187:8">Page 187</a>  "If ye <b>love</b> me, keep my commandments.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#187:10">Page 187</a>   This is the first mention, I believe, in the gospel, of the disciples' <b>love</b> for the Son of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#187:11">Page 187</a>   And He prays the Father for the gift of the Comforter in distinct connection with the fact that there is a company here of those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#187:12">Page 187</a>   Now, I say to the youngest believer here, the very fact that you desire to be here for Christ shows that you belong to the company of those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#187:15">Page 187</a>   I believe the first awakening of <b>love</b> to the Son of God is when He establishes a personal link between Himself and our hearts<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#188:5">Page 188</a>   It is not a question of how much doctrine we know, but how much are our hearts exult with great joy in the blessed fact that a divine Person, the Son of God, has made us conscious of His <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#188:6">Page 188</a>   Think of Him coming into this world to bring to us all the favour, and blessing, and joy that divine <b>love</b> could offer, and securing it for us by an act that puts the seal of His <b>love</b> for ever on our hearts!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#188:7">Page 188</a>   He went into death that His <b>love</b> might be known by our hearts!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#188:9">Page 188</a>   It is in the apprehension of this that we become conscious of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#188:11">Page 188</a>   The effect of this is that we <b>love</b> Him; we cannot help it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#188:14">Page 188</a>   But I believe what marked them, and made them precious to the Father and to Him, was that they were conscious of His <b>love</b>, and they were bound to Him in affection.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#188:20">Page 188</a>   Has He so put the seal of His <b>love</b> on our hearts -- so established His <b>love</b> there -- that He has become everything to us, and all outside Him is a blank?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#189:5">Page 189</a>   He had brought divine <b>love</b> to them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#189:6">Page 189</a>  In  John 14  the Lord regards His disciples as a company in whom there is response to His <b>love</b>, and He says, "If ye <b>love</b> me, keep my commandments.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#189:8">Page 189</a>   The gift of the Comforter is in distinct connection with the fact that we <b>love</b> Him, and it is the blessed mission of the Comforter to maintain our hearts in affection for the absent One.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#189:12">Page 189</a>   If we are not delivered from the influence of these things they will greatly hamper us, and hinder the response of our hearts to divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#190:4">Page 190</a>   The world may seem very attractive with its vast political machinery, its great educational schemes, and its philanthropic institutions; but, beloved friends, it is exposed for those who <b>love</b> the Son of God in the very fact that it has rejected Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#190:5">Page 190</a>   For those who <b>love</b> Him the world is thoroughly exposed; we have no respect for its pretensions; our hearts have broken with it and are free from its influence, because the Person who has made Himself everything to us has not found a bit of response in it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#191:1">Page 191</a>   That is, He was going out of the sphere of sight, but as an unseen Person He would have His own to be linked with Him in faith and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#191:5">Page 191</a>   It is a great thing for us to be in some measure delivered from these things, for it is only as we are thus delivered that we really enter into the thoughts of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#191:6">Page 191</a>  The Son of God has brought divine <b>love</b> here.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#191:8">Page 191</a>   Everything that is not the outcome of divine <b>love</b> will break down sooner or later, and we do well to take this to heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#191:9">Page 191</a>   But there is something that cannot break down -- that cannot fail -- and that is divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#191:10">Page 191</a>   I am sure the effect of knowing even a little of this <b>love</b> is greatly to draw us to the blessed Person who has brought it to us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#191:14">Page 191</a>   But I should like to ask, Do you know what it is to get near to the Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God, that He may lead your heart into the blessedness of His own <b>love</b>?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#191:15">Page 191</a>   He may give us a taste of that <b>love</b>, as it were, at a distance, but it is in order to draw us to Himself, that we may learn it fully in His own company.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#191:16">Page 191</a>   Satan will do his best to divert us by all possible means from entering into this, but if our hearts have really come under the power of divine <b>love</b> we shall not be diverted<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#192:1">Page 192</a>   John had come under the power of that blessed <b>love</b>, and responded to it, leaning on Jesus' bosom.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#192:2">Page 192</a>   It seems to me that  John 13  is the school of <b>love</b> The Master teaches divine <b>love</b> in perfection; the disciple learns with his head pillowed on that Master's bosom; and the result of the learning is that the disciples can be told to "<b>Love</b> one another; as I have loved you".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#192:3">Page 192</a>  What a wonderful thing it is to get into His company to learn there how He loves; because His <b>love</b> does not ignore what the flesh is, nor does it forget our liability to be influenced and defiled by what is around us here.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#192:5">Page 192</a>   It is a blessed thing to know that His <b>love</b> has secured to itself the title to regard us apart from everything that is unworthy of that <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#192:7">Page 192</a>   His death has set Him free, if we might say so, to <b>love</b> us, and as we appropriate His death it sets us free to be loved.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#192:8">Page 192</a>   On His side <b>love</b> is free, and as we appropriate His death we appropriate that which sets us free in spirit from all the sin and imperfection of the flesh, and we are  free to be loved .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#192:9">Page 192</a>   The Lord Jesus looks upon us according to the thoughts of His <b>love</b>, and according to the perfect sanctification of His death, and thus apart from every trace of imperfection.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#192:11">Page 192</a>   No, He saw it in its beauty, according to the thoughts of His own <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#192:13">Page 192</a>   There can be nothing more blessed than to be free to enter into the <b>love</b> of divine Persons.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#192:14">Page 192</a>   It is eternal life, and the effect of it comes out in <b>love</b> one to another.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#192:17">Page 192</a>   All hearts there will be full of divine <b>love</b>, and bound together in that <b>love</b> by the all-pervading Spirit<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#193:2">Page 193</a>  In  John 14  the Lord says, as it were, While I have been with you I made you conscious of My <b>love</b>, and made known to you the thoughts of My <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#193:4">Page 193</a>   He will maintain in your remembrance the communications of <b>love</b> by which I attach you to Myself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#193:7">Page 193</a>   A young believer might say, If I could have been with the Lord I am sure He would have made me conscious of His <b>love</b>, and I should have known that <b>love</b> much better than I do now.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#193:8">Page 193</a>   Well, beloved friends, the Comforter has come to maintain in our affections those blessed communications by which the Son of God established the knowledge of His <b>love</b> in the hearts of His little company of disciples when He was here with them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#193:11">Page 193</a>   And in verse 23, "If any one <b>love</b> me, he will keep my word".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#193:12">Page 193</a>   As I understand it, His "commandments" are the expression of the pleasure of His <b>love</b> concerning  His own , and His "word" is the expression of all that He is in  Himself .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#193:13">Page 193</a>   He says, "This is my commandment, that we <b>love</b> one another".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#193:14">Page 193</a>   That is the pleasure of His <b>love</b> concerning us, and if we <b>love</b> Him we keep His commandments.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#194:1">Page 194</a>   That is, the Comforter comes to maintain our hearts in those blessed affections which were formed by the communications of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#194:14">Page 194</a>   There is immense power in getting to God's side of things, and in seeing that there are things which cannot break down, because they subsist in the power of divine <b>love</b> and by the Spirit of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#194:15">Page 194</a>   It is certain that everything else will break down; everything that has not its outcome from divine <b>love</b>, and that is not in the power of the Spirit, will break down.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#196:8">Page 196</a>   And we, marvellous to say, are brought into a circle of things which could only be originated and carried out by divine Persons -- a circle of things where everything is the outcome of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#196:14">Page 196</a>   And we are privileged to stand by and hear one divine Person speaking to another, and occupied about us who are brought in infinite <b>love</b> within the circle of the Father's counsels.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#196:15">Page 196</a>   And not only so, but the Comforter has come to lead us into the knowledge of those counsels, and into the ineffable satisfaction and joy of the divine <b>love</b> which has originated them, and which will give effect to them in a universe of bliss for ever.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#197:17">Page 197</a>   It is a marvellous thing that we should have been taken up, and enriched and blessed by divine <b>love</b>, so that the glory of the Father and the Son should be displayed in us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#198:2">Page 198</a>   In the circle of divine <b>love</b> we are outside the range of the natural man altogether; we are in a region where nothing can sustain us but the Comforter, and He is here for that purpose.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#198:3">Page 198</a>  Then the consummation of everything is that we are to be with the Son where He is, to behold His glory which the Father has given Him -- a glory connected with the <b>love</b> which the Father had for Him before the foundation of the world.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#198:6">Page 198</a>   "I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known: that the <b>love</b> with which thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#198:11">Page 198</a>   And if we are responsive to divine <b>love</b>, He will guide us into the knowledge of those counsels in which the blessedness of that <b>love</b> reveals itself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#198:13">Page 198</a>  POWER DEPENDENT ON <b>LOVE</b> John 14:15 , 16 I would suggest that divine Persons commit Their power to <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#199:14">Page 199</a>  Now there is a further thought: God commits His power to  <b>love</b> .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#199:15">Page 199</a>   Only <b>love</b> can be trusted with power.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#199:16">Page 199</a>   If power were given to a man without <b>love</b>, it would only make him self-important; but <b>love</b> -- the divine nature -- can be trusted with power.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#199:17">Page 199</a>   When the Lord speaks of the other Comforter, He says, "If ye <b>love</b> me, keep my commandments.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#199:19">Page 199</a>   How much do we <b>love</b> Him?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#199:20">Page 199</a>   I believe the blessed God delights to commit His power to those who are formed in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#199:21">Page 199</a>   <b>Love</b> would be prepared to sacrifice itself in every possible way to secure the spiritual profit of the assembly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#199:22">Page 199</a>   God would not be faithful to Himself if He did not support from heaven both collectively and individually those who are imbued with the spirit of <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#200:1">Page 200</a>   The Spirit is here to serve as our resource, but it is  <b>love</b>  that takes advantage of His presence.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#200:8">Page 200</a>   ( Hymn 51 ) In His company we cannot fail to be imbued with the spirit of <b>love</b>;  then  we can be trusted with power.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#200:11">Page 200</a>   It has been said that His power is the servant of His <b>love</b>, and each one of us has spiritual power in proportion as we have <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#200:14">Page 200</a>   Power became the servant of <b>love</b>, and power is commensurate with <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#200:17">Page 200</a>   <b>Love</b> says, "Lord, if it be  thou , command me to come to thee upon the waters".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#201:7">Page 201</a>   All is suggestive of conditions at the close of the present dispensation, and of the way in which power is available to those who <b>love</b> Christ and are prepared to move towards Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#202:5">Page 202</a>   But notwithstanding this, we cannot help seeing how little they entered into what was present with them in the Son of God, or into the communications of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#203:25">Page 203</a>   No one but the Comforter could make the Son of God a present reality to our hearts, or give us the joy of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#204:10">Page 204</a>   The whole of this blessed and divine system of <b>love</b> is pervaded by the Spirit and it is He who gives the intelligence of it for our souls' deep joy.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#206:26">Page 206</a>   "As the Father has loved me, I also have loved you" -- that is <b>love</b> of complacency not the <b>love</b> of sovereignty just as the Father discerned in Him all that was suited to His <b>love</b> so that the Father loved Him -- it was the <b>love</b> of complacency -- so it is here<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#207:1">Page 207</a>   The Son would <b>love</b> them with the <b>love</b> of complacency when He formed in them what was suited to His <b>love</b> as having come under His own blessed influence.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#207:2">Page 207</a>   "As the Father has loved me, I also have loved you: abide in  my  <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#207:29">Page 207</a>   "Abide in me" -- "Believe in me", and "<b>Love</b> one another".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#207:33">Page 207</a>   He had spoken of His <b>love</b> to a company in chapter 13 and then He suggests in chapter 14 a company loving Him, and then His commandments are not grievous.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#207:36">Page 207</a>   Joy is dependent upon the obedience of  <b>love</b>  -- not legal obedience.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#208:1">Page 208</a>   The Lord walked in the unbroken joy of the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#208:3">Page 208</a>   The Lord says, "<b>Love</b> one another, as I have loved you".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#208:5">Page 208</a>   The way the Lord's <b>love</b> worked was that He laid down His life.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#208:10">Page 208</a>   It is on the wrong tack to be expecting from others; we are under the obligation to <b>love</b> one another.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#208:12">Page 208</a>   It is after all only sap from the vine which is expressed in us, if we do <b>love</b> one another.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#210:11">Page 210</a>   It is the joy of His <b>love</b> to have our companionship in that place.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#212:2">Page 212</a>   His purposes of <b>love</b> were not seen in the works, but in giving men a part and place with the Son in the Father's house.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#213:3">Page 213</a>   "As the Father has loved me, I also have loved you: abide in my <b>love</b>" ( John 15:9 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#213:4">Page 213</a>   This is clearly a complacent <b>love</b>, for it is  as  the Father has loved Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#213:6">Page 213</a>   "If ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my <b>love</b>, as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his <b>love</b>" (verse 10).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#213:7">Page 213</a>   He has a peculiar joy in His saints as those who keep His commandments: obedient lovers are the only ones who afford Him this joy, or who really abide in His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#214:1">Page 214</a>   It is now as glorified that He gives effect to every thought of divine <b>love</b>, and thus glorifies the Father.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#214:14">Page 214</a>   Eternal life and sonship for men are the two great thoughts of divine <b>love</b>, and it is the joy of the son to secure them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#215:13">Page 215</a>  The "men" saw in Jesus One who was in relationship with God as His Father, and they had a sense that the Father's <b>love</b> rested upon Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#215:14">Page 215</a>   The last verse of the chapter shows that the making known of the Father's Name brings the <b>love</b> with which He loved the Son into those to whom it is made known.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#216:10">Page 216</a>   That is to say that His joy is brought to completion in His own as they take in the great thoughts of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#225:12">Page 225</a>   The depths of infinite divine grace and <b>love</b> and holiness -- for it is "Holy Father" -- are in that name, and all was given to the Son that He might make it known.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#226:4">Page 226</a>   The goodness, grace, <b>love</b>, and glory of that name are all told out, and the One who made it known is the One who can instruct our hearts in it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#226:9">Page 226</a>   The Son would have us enclosed in all the blessedness of the Father's name, kept in the grace of that name, kept in the <b>love</b> of which it speaks!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#227:12">Page 227</a>   It has been given to Him to bring to pass every purpose of <b>love</b> and blessing that was in the Father's heart from eternity.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#228:3">Page 228</a>   This place the Father's eternal <b>love</b> has given Him; it will be His distinctive glory for ever.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#229:7">Page 229</a>   I speak not -- for the moment -- of atonement, but of all those ceaseless activities of grace, in which He was the Servant of Jehovah's pleasure, and the Son of His Father's <b>love</b> as a Man upon the earth.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#229:8">Page 229</a>  Then I trust every heart in this company has lingered with adoring thoughts of faith and <b>love</b> in presence of the work accomplished on the cross.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#230:8">Page 230</a>  His first action -- and surely <b>love</b> would have it so -- was to meet and satisfy the longings of a heart that had no object but Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#230:12">Page 230</a>   that we may treasure them in our hearts -- "He that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will <b>love</b> him and will manifest myself to him" ( John 14:21 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#230:14">Page 230</a>   She loved Him, and her <b>love</b> called forth the expression of His.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#231:4">Page 231</a>   Has the treasure we have found in His <b>love</b> really separated our hearts from everything here?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#232:5">Page 232</a>   It was nothing but Himself, and the consciousness of His presence and <b>love</b> borne into her heart, as the well-known Shepherd's voice called His sheep by name.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#232:9">Page 232</a>   It was to a heart like that that the blessed Lord could make communications which surpass all human thought -- to such a heart He could unfold what divine <b>love</b> would do for its own delight in the blessing of its objects.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#232:10">Page 232</a>  Her <b>love</b>  would have kept Him here, and been content to follow Him still as the Messiah upon earth; rejected and dishonoured indeed, but still to her the chiefest among ten thousand and altogether lovely.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#232:11">Page 232</a>   But  His <b>love</b>  had its own secrets, and He tenderly set aside her thoughts that He might replace them by His own.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#232:17">Page 232</a>   He has those in this world whom he owns as His brethren -- His Father is their Father, and His God is their God, and His <b>love</b> would have them to know this new place of association with Himself as the Risen One<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#233:5">Page 233</a>   If not, depend upon it we have not really taken in the thoughts of His <b>love</b>, and it may be the Lord has not found in us that freshness of affection for Himself that would set Him free to communicate those thoughts to us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#233:14">Page 233</a>   Instead of holy thirstings after Christ, and the joy of His <b>love</b>, there is nothing in their soul's secret history but sadness and reproach.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#234:12">Page 234</a>   He loved the Lord, and he was confident in the strength of his <b>love</b>, and he needed to learn what a bruised reed he was.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#235:1">Page 235</a>   We know not what passed at that private interview, but I will venture to say that there was so much confession on Simon's part, and so much tender and gracious <b>love</b> on the Lord's part, that when the Lord and Simon met again, within the closed doors in the evening, no uneasiness or shyness remained to hinder Simon from enjoying the presence of his Lord.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#235:2">Page 235</a>  If there is a Peter here tonight -- one who has failed, and dishonoured the Lord -- I can tell you that that dishonoured Lord loves you still, and it would give His heart great joy to remove the soil from your conscience and to make you happy in His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#235:7">Page 235</a>   He makes you conscious of your sin, but He does not fail to assure your heart of the constancy of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#235:9">Page 235</a>   Every link bears the stamp of divine and changeless <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#235:15">Page 235</a>   Make a clean breast of the whole matter; go to the very bottom of it with Him; and you will find that He will remove the shade from your heart and the stain from your conscience, and give you a deeper sense of His <b>love</b> than you ever had before<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#238:14">Page 238</a>  May we better understand that it is the purpose of His <b>love</b> to have us here for Himself, and that all the wonderful grace that meets us in our need -- whether it be that of the sorrowing heart, the soiled conscience or the straying feet -- is bent upon dealing with us in such a way as to free us for Himself and for His own company!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#241:4">Page 241</a>   Ascension is relative to all that lies ahead, so it brings into view the whole position of the blessing which divine <b>love</b> has purposed and has brought to us by the ascension of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#247:7">Page 247</a>   We are reminded of His own <b>love</b> in that He gave Himself for the assembly, and of God's <b>love</b> as witnessed by the blood and water from the riven side.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#248:25">Page 248</a>   that was the witness of all the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#248:26">Page 248</a>   If the one cuts us off from the world, the other introduces to a new world filled with divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#251:2">Page 251</a>   That is not to meet our need, but it is the outcome of the thought of the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#251:4">Page 251</a>   All the action of the Spirit in the believer carries him in the direction of eternal life, so that what is before God's heart is before man's heart, and we are brought into line with the purpose of the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#251:5">Page 251</a>   God's <b>love</b> has thought of eternal life for us, and it is a very great thing.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#256:9">Page 256</a>  The more we contemplate the Son of God in His mediatorial position the more shall we perceive the infinitude and blessedness of the <b>love</b> of God expressed in the gift of such a Person.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#256:10">Page 256</a>   He has come within the range of men's apprehension as given by God in <b>love</b> to the world ( John 3:16 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#256:12">Page 256</a>   <b>Love</b> would have been ineffective if He had not done so, and this could not be when the <b>love</b> was God's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#256:13">Page 256</a>   "Herein as to us has been manifested the <b>love</b> of God, that God has sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#256:14">Page 256</a>   Herein is <b>love</b>, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son a propitiation for our sins",  1 John 4:9 , 10.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#256:15">Page 256</a>   Our hearts engage themselves believingly and adoringly with the glorious Person of the Son of God; we view Him in holy manhood, and going into death, and we perceive the <b>love</b> of God, for it was God who sent and gave Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#257:4">Page 257</a>   On the contrary, it brings out fully the wondrous and blessed fact that the <b>love</b> of God is made known to men in the only way in which it could be made known; that is, mediatorially in His beloved Son as Man on earth.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#257:5">Page 257</a>   The whole point of the statements of Scripture is to show that the <b>love</b> of God has come into tangible expression.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#257:8">Page 257</a>   He was in the presence of Nicodemus when He spoke of Himself as given by God in <b>love</b>; He was before men's eyes all through John's gospel as the Sent One.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#257:9">Page 257</a>   And when the hour came for supreme expression to be given to the <b>love</b> of God, that <b>love</b> to men was so great that He did not spare the One who was so holy, so delightful to His heart, so beloved by Him, but delivered Him up for us all.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#258:2">Page 258</a>   He provided in that relationship what was suitable to convey to the mind and heart of the creature conceptions of <b>love</b> in authority and of <b>love</b> in obedience which He could use, when the fulness of time came for Him to do so, as a divinely formed setting for the revelation of Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#260:7">Page 260</a>   Isaac is, typically, Christ as the Son of His Father's <b>love</b>, begotten and conceived in a power altogether above nature; afterwards, in figure, offered up as a burnt-offering, and raised from the dead, to have a wife of His own kindred.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#261:13">Page 261</a>   He was begotten of God; He was the subject of God the Father's <b>love</b> and care; He was ever in subjection, carrying out in obedience His Father's will; He was ever instructed ( Isaiah 50:4 ), and He ever honoured and served His Father.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#262:2">Page 262</a>   He received all from the Father; He was ever under the Father's commandment, the object of the Father's <b>love</b>, and abiding in that <b>love</b> as keeping the Father's commandments.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#262:8">Page 262</a>  It is the very perfection and glory of the blessed knowledge of God which is given to men through infinite grace that it comes to us through One who is God, but who came, by a descent of infinite <b>love</b>, into the place and relationship of the Son of God in obedience here.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#262:11">Page 262</a>   In a father <b>love</b> is conjoined with care and authority; in a son <b>love</b> is conjoined with obedience and service<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#264:3">Page 264</a>   A divine Person as Man must be perfect in the place and condition into which He has come in <b>love</b> and obedience, and He could say, "My God" as no other man ever could.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#264:14">Page 264</a>   The great grace and mystery of the incarnation is that, in self-humiliation and by a descent of infinite <b>love</b>, our Lord has taken a position as Man which is lower than the position which ever belongs to Him as God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#265:10">Page 265</a>   But the activities of the Son and the Spirit are both subordinated to the purpose of divine <b>love</b> that God should be known as the Father.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#265:12">Page 265</a>   The Son has made Him known mediatorially, and the Spirit is sent and given so that His <b>love</b> may be shed abroad in the hearts of believers, and that they may, as having the Spirit of sonship, cry, "Abba, Father".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#266:3">Page 266</a>   But the Son and the Spirit have been pleased to take a relative place which is not commensurate with Their full personal glory, but which is essential to the accomplishment of the purposes of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#268:12">Page 268</a>   That is a region utterly beyond creature apprehension; and it is our wisdom to recognise that the greatness of God is unsearchable ( Psalm 145:3 ), and to be content with the blessed light which has come to us in infinite <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#269:11">Page 269</a>  The Son, as a divine Person in manhood, speaking to the Father in the wondrous prayer of  John 17 , refers to a glory which He shared, and a <b>love</b> of which He was the object, prior to His incarnation, and, indeed, before the world was (verses 5, 24).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#269:12">Page 269</a>   The glory and the <b>love</b> were His as in eternal Deity.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#279:11">Page 279</a>   She dispenses honour to those who <b>love</b> her, and fills their treasuries.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#280:7">Page 280</a>  I do not think that  Proverbs 8  can be understood, consistently with the whole truth, except by seeing that it is the voice of wisdom abstractly viewed, but personified as a female who can speak, <b>love</b>, bestow favours, and have delights.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#281:3">Page 281</a>   That is, the whole scope of the truth as to God, as it has come to light through infinite grace and <b>love</b> by the incarnation of the Son, and as a result of His death and exaltation, is brought to all disciples now, and they are brought to it, in the sacred formula of  Matthew 28:19 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac29.htm#282:2">Page 282</a>   Everything that concerns the personal and mediatorial glory of the Son of God is of deep interest to those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<h3>Volume 30 - Miscellaneous Ministry on the Old Testament</h3>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#4:12">Page 4</a>   You know there is a solemn scripture connected with the gospel, "If any one <b>love</b> not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be Anathema Maranatha" ( 1 Corinthians 16:22 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#4:15">Page 4</a>   Because they <b>love</b> the world and <b>love</b> to have their own way and will not submit themselves to God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#7:20">Page 7</a>   The very judgment that rested upon you and upon me has been taken in <b>love</b> by the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#10:11">Page 10</a>   Now Christ has brought in a new atmosphere for us to live in, and if I may so describe it, I should say the atmosphere of a Christian's life is made up of peace and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#10:12">Page 10</a>   When Christ came into this world these two things, peace and <b>love</b>, came in His blessed Person.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#10:13">Page 10</a>   Divine peace and divine <b>love</b> came in for the first time.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#11:1">Page 11</a>   And divine life and <b>love</b>, never known in this world until Christ died (I mean in its fulness), has now come.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#11:2">Page 11</a>   Scripture says, "Herein as to us has been manifested the <b>love</b> of God, that God has sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him" ( 1 John 4:9 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#11:3">Page 11</a>   <b>Love</b> came out thus, and now the proper atmosphere for your soul and mine is the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#11:6">Page 11</a>   We have not to reach the <b>love</b> by some kind of effort.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#11:8">Page 11</a>   There is one entitled  The Imitation of Christ  written by a man who lived many years ago, where we may read a great deal about the <b>love</b> of God, and which puts people on the line of making effort to reach the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#11:9">Page 11</a>   I do not think this of any use; the <b>love</b> of God has been brought to us by Christ and made known to us by His death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#12:19">Page 12</a>   That, I suppose, is why the wife is to be subject to her husband; she is under rule in that way, not a legal rule, but a rule of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#13:6">Page 13</a>   He brings in the light of God, a new atmosphere of <b>love</b>, the food, and then the rule.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#15:9">Page 15</a>   Not only is the tree of life the object of my faith and <b>love</b>; but there is the river, God's blessed Spirit, to water the garden now.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#16:7">Page 16</a>   You find in  John 14  that the Lord speaks to His disciples for the first time of their <b>love</b> to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#16:8">Page 16</a>   He had spoken before of His <b>love</b> to them, but here He says, "If ye <b>love</b> me, keep my commandments.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#16:11">Page 16</a>   These are the people who receive the Spirit, people who <b>love</b> the Son of God, and the Spirit comes in to maintain the heart of the believer in freshness of affection for the Son of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#17:2">Page 17</a>   It is the river of God flowing through the garden of the soul to make it fruitful and to bring forth the fruit of the Spirit  --  <b>love</b>, joy, peace and so on  --  that the moral traits of Christ may be reproduced in the believer through the effect of the river of God in the soul.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#18:10">Page 18</a>   The purposes of God show us the nature of His thoughts and delights  --  they instruct us in all that God has before Him for the satisfaction of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#19:1">Page 19</a>   The more we consider this great subject the more we shall discover in it the unfolding of what God is in wisdom, power, grace, and <b>love</b>  --  and all this while acting for the supreme good of man  --  and we shall plainly discern that Christ is the Crown of all the ways of God, and this will make Him very great and glorious in the estimation of our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#32:4">Page 32</a>   That which is most dwelt on and which Scripture is greatly occupied with is the question of good and evil; but there is another question which lies behind it, and that is the eternal purpose of God for the satisfaction of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#32:5">Page 32</a>   Before ever evil came in, God's purpose was to have sons before Him for the pleasure of His own <b>love</b>, formed for that purpose in Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#32:6">Page 32</a>   There is no question of good and evil there, nothing to consider but the thoughts of His own <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#32:9">Page 32</a>   "That we should be holy and blameless before him in <b>love</b>" -- that has to do with the question of good and evil; our being holy and without blame stands in that connection.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#36:18">Page 36</a>   He calls a man out to give him a special portion, thought of by His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#36:19">Page 36</a>   It is not what man needed or desired, but what God desired and proposed to gratify His own <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#36:21">Page 36</a>   Think of God giving a portion to man so that man may know His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#36:22">Page 36</a>   Sometimes a man comes into an inheritance in an arbitrary way, perhaps his father has not much power over it, but this inheritance is the outcome of the beneficence of God's <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#37:1">Page 37</a>   If we want to know His <b>love</b> we must know something of the inheritance.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#38:22">Page 38</a>   If you see that, you take every affliction as a mark of divine <b>love</b> -- "I rebuke and discipline as many as I <b>love</b>" ( Revelation 3:19 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#41:24">Page 41</a>   You will have no power to retain the spirit, and those who <b>love</b> you best on earth will not be able to help you.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#42:12">Page 42</a>   Though we have forfeited everything by our sin and have justly fallen under death and judgment, divine <b>love</b> has undertaken for us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#42:15">Page 42</a>   His holy hatred of sin has been made known, His righteousness manifested in dealing with it, His <b>love</b>, grace and boundless mercy toward man have been expressed in the gift of His only-begotten Son, and His power set forth in raising up the Lord Jesus from the dead when all had been accomplished.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#42:16">Page 42</a>   There is not a single attribute of God that has not been vindicated at the cross, and His blessed nature of holy <b>love</b> has fully expressed itself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#44:8">Page 44</a>  Now let us see how perfectly the Lord Jesus has identified Himself with us in wondrous grace and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#45:1">Page 45</a>   If our history as children of Adam must close in death, how blessed to know that the Son of God has come into death for us, that in the place of our condemnation we might find not only divine <b>love</b> and grace in our favour, but divine righteousness also.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#45:12">Page 45</a>   The greatness of His Person enabled Him to bear and exhaust that infinite judgment, but who can measure the perfect <b>love</b>, the absolute devotedness to God, the holy and unswerving obedience, the deep perfection of every motive of His heart under God's eye in that matchless offering of Himself?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#46:7">Page 46</a>   Thus on the ground of the burnt-offering God will gratify His own nature in having us in righteousness, joy and holy <b>love</b> before His face, "conformed to the image of his Son, so that he should be the firstborn among many brethren" ( Romans 8:29 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#46:16">Page 46</a>   We have been separated from the world by God's grace and by His work in our souls, that we might come into a circle where the <b>love</b> of Christ is known.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#47:3">Page 47</a>   And now His <b>love</b> is active towards it that He may have it in entire moral suitability to Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#47:4">Page 47</a>   Everything that is of the world and of the flesh -- everything that is not morally "glorious" -- must be removed so that He may rest in His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#47:6">Page 47</a>   We shall be prepared to yield ourselves, if I may so say, to the activities of His sanctifying <b>love</b> so that everything about us which has not been wrought in us by God may be set aside.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#47:7">Page 47</a>   We shall not be reluctant to let the things of earth go if we understand that their going sets us more free to know the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#47:9">Page 47</a>   As the <b>love</b> of Christ holds us, we are ready to leave without regret the things which once were necessary to us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#47:10">Page 47</a>   And as we leave things here, we  prove  that there is infinite compensation in the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#47:12">Page 47</a>   That assembly for which Christ gave Himself, and which He sanctifies, that He may present it to Himself for the satisfaction of His own <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#50:20">Page 50</a>   It is not a question of getting thoughts and ideas, but He is so glorious, so wondrous, He has such dignity, and yet withal He is so near to us in <b>love</b> that if we see Him at all we must worship Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#52:13">Page 52</a>   That is not a transaction taking place in the depths of Deity; it is a blessed Man, given in divine <b>love</b>, who comes within our view.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#52:14">Page 52</a>   We see the loved Son, we see what He is for the delight of God, and then we see the <b>love</b> of God manifested in that He was offered up.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#53:16">Page 53</a>   The wealth of God consists in the thoughts of His <b>love</b>, and there is One in manhood great enough to inherit that, and He has gone into death in order that those who have no personal title to inherit anything shall on a righteous ground inherit with Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#53:23">Page 53</a>   The bosom of the Son is open to those who <b>love</b> Him; they can have the most intimate place; there is nothing to hinder any one of us from being there<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#54:1">Page 54</a>   The only thing that is wanted is <b>love</b> -- do we <b>love</b> Him enough to want to be there?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#54:7">Page 54</a>   Then the thought of pre-eminence is very much presented by the Spirit in Joseph; he is seen to be pre-eminent in his father's <b>love</b>; we are told Israel loved him more than all his sons, and he made him a vest of many colours.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#54:8">Page 54</a>   He is seen to be publicly distinguished as pre-eminent in his father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#54:11">Page 54</a>   The Father's voice and the descent of the Spirit were all like a vest of many colours; they spoke of the pre-eminent place that He had in the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#55:1">Page 55</a>   Joseph's brethren began by hating him because of his pre-eminence in the father's <b>love</b>, but they ended by being subdued to accepting his pre-eminence by discovering his ability to preserve them in life; they had been absolutely shut up to him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#56:9">Page 56</a>   The great proof of the <b>love</b> of God to the world is that He gave His only-begotten Son.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#56:11">Page 56</a>   The only-begotten Son was present before the eyes of Nicodemus -- the manifestation of the <b>love</b> of God in manhood; and we are welcome to appropriate Him in His greatness, which is expressed in His name.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#56:14">Page 56</a>   And then He is "Counsellor"; this sets forth the wisdom that is in Him to carry out in fulness and in permanence every thought of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#56:16">Page 56</a>   And He is the "Father of Eternity"; we <b>love</b> to think that the coming age is going to derive its character and its blessedness from the Son.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#58:9">Page 58</a>   He came down in a marvellous descent of infinite <b>love</b>, and brought all that belonged to heaven with Him -- He went to the cross and was offered up, and as risen then He ascended up where He was before.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#59:1">Page 59</a>   This glorious Person is definitely given to us as an Object of faith and <b>love</b>, and as He becomes our Object we have life in His name; we live in all that which He has brought to us as the blessed gift of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#60:3">Page 60</a>  Joseph's words, indeed, at times seemed harsh, "He spoke roughly unto them", and some of his dealings appeared severe; but he had one definite object and end before him in it all, which was, as we know, that when they were humbled and subdued, he might lavish his <b>love</b> upon them and have them in enjoyed nearness to himself -- fear and distance removed, so far as he could effect it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#60:5">Page 60</a>   When this is effected, the pent-up feelings of Joseph in yearning <b>love</b> can be expressed; and his delight was to say, "Come near to me, I pray you", speaking to their hearts and giving them the kiss of reconciliation and <b>love</b>, and finding his joy in so doing.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#61:1">Page 61</a>   His (the Lord's) brethren, as He will call them in marvellous and infinite grace, He will deal with in perfect wisdom and <b>love</b>, first to bring them to repentance and mourning and confession; as so graphically described in  Zephaniah 12:10 : "And I will pour upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplications; and they shall look on me whom they pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for an only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#61:8">Page 61</a>   will save: he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his <b>love</b>; he will exult over thee with singing".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#62:3">Page 62</a>   We have also seen that while in <b>love</b> he yearns over them, and specially over Benjamin, yet he will not disclose himself nor gratify his <b>love</b> until he has 'divined' and searched out their inward feelings and exercises of heart; and who can read the touching confession, the eloquent appeal of Judah on behalf of Benjamin, without being deeply moved, and responsively appreciate Joseph's feelings and attitude, when all was found out?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#62:6">Page 62</a>   even as inspired history, is all this; and precious to see in Joseph the spirit of Christ displaying itself so touchingly in tender forgiving <b>love</b>, in a man "of like passions" ( Acts 14:15 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#64:1">Page 64</a>  ", He could, and did, in matchless tenderness and <b>love</b>, say to that poor woman, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water" ( John 4:10 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#64:2">Page 64</a>   Here, indeed, is the 'glory that excelleth', for it is the glory of perfect divine grace and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#64:6">Page 64</a>   blessed Lord, we joy to look up to Thee now in that place of supreme exaltation and honour where Thou art now, and say to Thee with adoring hearts, 'In Thy blest face all glories shine,  And there we gaze on <b>love</b> divine'.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#64:17">Page 64</a>   In full and perfect <b>love</b> He "gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all lawlessness, and purify to himself a peculiar people (that is, a company peculiarly 'His own'), zealous for good works" ( Titus 2:14 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#66:1">Page 66</a>   How beautifully and perfectly we have all this -- both our guilty perishing condition, and the compassion and <b>love</b> of God -- portrayed by the Lord Jesus in  Luke 15  already referred to, where the activities in <b>love</b> of the whole Godhead are pictured -- the seeking -- the finding, the repentance -- the rejoicing over the repentant sinner and the never-ending joy in the father's house.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#66:4">Page 66</a>  All these ways of divine <b>love</b> towards us have then, for their object, to bring us into, and make us participators of, all the wealth of blessing, all the joy and glory and honour which that <b>love</b> had long before provided and treasured up for us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#67:9">Page 67</a>   But more, he will have them near himself, for the satisfaction of his <b>love</b>, and for his ministry to them, for, said he, "There will I maintain thee" ( Genesis 45:11 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#67:11">Page 67</a>   The believer, whose conscience and heart are in the light and confidence of all this, can take up and appropriate the triumphant challenge of the apostle in  Romans 8:35 , "Who shall separate us from the <b>love</b> of Christ?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#67:12">Page 67</a>  " and declare, like him, his persuasion that "neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the <b>love</b> of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord" (verses 38, 39)<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#74:8">Page 74</a>   God would do anything for a creature who could say to Him, 'My God, I <b>love</b> Thee, I want Thy will, I want the support of all Thy resources'.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#85:24">Page 85</a>   "We do know that all things work together for good to those who <b>love</b> God" ( Romans 8:28 ).<br>

<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#92:1">Page 92</a>   The great expression of the <b>love</b> of God to believers is that He gives the Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#93:12">Page 93</a>   God's object, in His grace and <b>love</b>, was to give us His Spirit.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#103:9">Page 103</a>   The death of Christ has not only revealed the <b>love</b> of God, but it has so settled every question connected with our responsibility as children of Adam that we are on an entirely new ground with God.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#113:15">Page 113</a>  Then we have the water from the smitten rock; that is the direct fruit and answer of the death of Christ, "the <b>love</b> of God shed abroad in our hearts".<br>

<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#155:8">Page 155</a>   Now I believe in christianity there is room for every suggestion of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#156:7">Page 156</a>   It was a spontaneous suggestion of <b>love</b>, and I believe there is room for every suggestion of <b>love</b> in the divine system, because a suggestion of <b>love</b> would never interfere with divine order.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#156:8">Page 156</a>   <b>Love</b> is the most orderly thing in the universe.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#158:17">Page 158</a>   I believe God will accept everything which involves personal cost, but which is a suggestion of <b>love</b> in relation to the work of the Lord.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#170:4">Page 170</a>  If you want a verse from the New Testament in connection with this I would like to read  Romans 5:5 , "And hope does not make ashamed, because the <b>love</b> of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us"; also verse 11, "And not only that, but we are making our boast in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom now we have received the reconciliation".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#170:6">Page 170</a>   So that it is not like something at a distance from me, but the <b>love</b> of God is shed abroad in my heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#170:7">Page 170</a>   How wonderful that He should give me His Spirit in order that my heart might have a capacity and capability to taste of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#170:8">Page 170</a>   How could I taste divine <b>love</b> if His Spirit were not given?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#170:18">Page 170</a>  In  1 Corinthians 2:9 , 10 it says, "Things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that <b>love</b> him, but God has revealed to us by his Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#171:11">Page 171</a>   Where are the things that God has prepared for them that <b>love</b> Him?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#174:13">Page 174</a>   The soul that gets the Spirit gets the consciousness of the <b>love</b> of God; there is a consciousness -- it may not last more than five minutes -- that God wants me, He wants to set His <b>love</b> on me; that in the heart makes me a Caleb.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#175:1">Page 175</a>   That is the position taken by those in whose hearts God has put the sense of His <b>love</b>, and the fellowship of His purpose of their coming into the land.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#175:6">Page 175</a>   The soul that has come into it and has the Spirit has the consciousness that God has taken us up for the pleasure of His <b>love</b>; it may not last long, but you have it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#176:12">Page 176</a>   In every case the offerer is identified with his offering; my spirit is identified with my appreciation of the self-sacrificing <b>love</b> of Christ; the conscious joy of acceptance marks me.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#178:16">Page 178</a>   It is the light of what is heavenly coming out in the saint; the life of Jesus was always poured out in the service of <b>love</b>; every feature of His life was delightful to God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#178:21">Page 178</a>   Would that be leaving first <b>love</b>?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#178:29">Page 178</a>   No, all this is properly heavenly and brings us to <b>love</b> the support of faith in the wilderness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#187:8">Page 187</a>   The things which I refer to at present were obligatory; no Israelite could disregard them; and neither can we disregard what they typify without disregarding the claims of divine <b>love</b>, and what is for our joy and the pleasure of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#188:3">Page 188</a>   All these things can be rendered as <b>love</b> prompts them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#188:11">Page 188</a>   For it is all brought about by divine <b>love</b> and divine giving, and it all tends to God finding satisfaction in having us before Him with our joy full.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#188:12">Page 188</a>   The only law that operates in the land is the perfect law of liberty; the only bondage that is known there is captivity in the chains of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#188:15">Page 188</a>   We should all be prepared to accept that as the thought of divine <b>love</b> for us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#188:16">Page 188</a>   We get the inheritance purely by the <b>love</b> and calling of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#189:2">Page 189</a>   Viewed as in the wilderness we prove the <b>love</b> of God and the <b>love</b> of Christ; we recognise there the lordship of Christ and the presence of the Spirit, and we may enjoy a great deal of grace and blessing; we may take up the privilege there of coming together to eat the Lord's supper.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#189:3">Page 189</a>   But all that, great as it is, is not the full pleasure of God's <b>love</b> for us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#189:5">Page 189</a>   We get the inheritance by the gift and appointment of the One who bestows it in <b>love</b> upon us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#189:9">Page 189</a>   We were born anew and redeemed by the precious blood of Christ that we might possess the inheritance which the <b>love</b> of God designed for us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#189:12">Page 189</a>  The inheritance is the fruit of the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#189:13">Page 189</a>   John says, "See what <b>love</b> the Father has given to us that we should be called the children of God".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#190:1">Page 190</a>   Such is the inheritance that He has allotted to us in sovereign <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#190:3">Page 190</a>   The <b>love</b> of God ever cherishes the inheritance for us and cherishes us for the inheritance; the youngest believer is entitled to take that home to himself in all its blessedness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#190:8">Page 190</a>  It is purely a question of God's sovereign <b>love</b>, and of where it has given us our portion.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#190:9">Page 190</a>  It is clear that what <b>love</b> gives can only be taken up and enjoyed by <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#190:12">Page 190</a>   But one is comforted to know that saints have an ear, and they <b>love</b>; it is the result of the work of God in them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#191:2">Page 191</a>   God works in His people; they are begotten of Him and He works to produce an ear and a heart so that they <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#192:14">Page 192</a>   Many quietly accept that the inheritance is given to them in the <b>love</b> of God, and they perhaps know what it is to be under showers of blessing in the way of ministry, but they are indolent and slothful, they are not carrying out diligently what Scripture calls "the business of your hand".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#193:5">Page 193</a>   If we accept that divine <b>love</b> has given us the inheritance let us cultivate it with purpose of heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#213:8">Page 213</a>   Have I the same kind of faith as she had: faith that will judge the world in its strongest and most established form, and separate from it, and that will identify itself with God and His people, and with all that God is going to do in the purposes of His <b>love</b> for the honour of His Son?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#214:20">Page 214</a>   If Rahab had not been drawn by cords of <b>love</b> she would not have had any wish to link herself with the people and servants of God; but she definitely linked herself with them when she let them down by a cord, and the men did not forget it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#223:22">Page 223</a>   In 1 John we get the warnings and the antidotes: we <b>love</b> our brother.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#229:14">Page 229</a>   This is really what is to touch our hearts and fill them with that expectancy of <b>love</b> that regards the Lord's coming with supreme anticipation of pleasure.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#230:4">Page 230</a>   It is the consciousness of the immediate support and <b>love</b> of the heart of Christ and the place we have eternally in our Father's heart and purpose that is our proper start: if we are to continue and to finish well we must make this beginning.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#230:9">Page 230</a>   The Lord does not forget our work of faith and labour of <b>love</b>, and if He has enlarged us and blessed us so that we have been able to minister to Him and to His own, He never forgets it.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#288:14">Page 288</a>   That there was holy submission, I doubt not, but His <b>love</b> had not acted as they expected.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#299:12">Page 299</a>   When you saw that your sins were all put away, and that God imputed righteousness to you -- righteousness the measure and expression of which is Christ risen -- you entered into peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, and received the Spirit, who shed the <b>love</b> of God abroad in your heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#300:6">Page 300</a>   We sang with triumph of His <b>love</b>, we exulted in His grace and in some true, if small, measure we did "joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#300:10">Page 300</a>  But it is not true that for some hearts here this joy of God's salvation, this rapture of "first <b>love</b>", has passed away and left an aching void?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#305:14">Page 305</a>   We are then able to leave self altogether behind, and to enter the atmosphere of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#305:16">Page 305</a>   <b>Love</b> thinks more of the Giver than of His gifts -- more of the <b>love</b> than of the work which <b>love</b> has wrought.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#308:1">Page 308</a>   This world has rewarded Christ evil for good, and hatred for His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#308:7">Page 308</a>   Every step of that pathway of lowly and devoted <b>love</b> has had its answer.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#309:10">Page 309</a>   Now, indeed, my heart has got a new Centre; and has begun to learn with God the greatness of the thoughts of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#309:11">Page 309</a>   I begin to realise the immensity of God's purpose and grace, and to be lost in wonder, <b>love</b>, and praise.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#310:3">Page 310</a>   Yet in this, as in everything else, He must have the pre-eminence; He is anointed "above" His fellows, and our faith and <b>love</b> rejoice that it should be so.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#310:17">Page 310</a>   The fragrance I take to be the fruit of the Spirit -- the qualities, graces, and moral perfections of Christ -- "<b>Love</b>, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance" ( Galatians 5:22 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#312:17">Page 312</a>   He has companions who <b>love</b> what He loves and hate what He hates.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#312:20">Page 312</a>   All His garments -- all the features of <b>love</b> which He wears -- are fragrant with the sweet odour of His having been in death<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#315:16">Page 315</a>   But it is in such circumstances that we learn we are inseparable from the <b>love</b> of Christ, and we come into view as His lilies among thorns.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#317:21">Page 317</a>   His garments would indicate what he is invested with: it speaks of fragrance in every form of <b>love</b> which He wears -- Revealer, Teacher, Priest, Advocate, Intercessor, Shepherd; we see Him in different garments.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#318:14">Page 318</a>   He rules by bringing His people to <b>love</b> what He loves and to hate what He hates.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#318:17">Page 318</a>   Myrrh -- His suffering <b>love</b> -- but aloes go along with it in the burial of the Lord.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#321:21">Page 321</a>   The great point of this is that the Son has come forth to bring to pass the pleasure of God and to do it all in the obedience of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#323:4">Page 323</a>   Christ fully undertakes for God, but then He makes known all God is for man: righteousness, <b>love</b>, truth; His delight is that others may know it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#323:9">Page 323</a>   He could say, "I know him" ( John 8:55 ): he could speak of the Father as One whom He knew, in whose <b>love</b> He dwelt and whose righteousness and faithfulness He was proving continually.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#325:3">Page 325</a>   Take the <b>love</b> of God, where do you learn it?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#325:7">Page 325</a>   The <b>love</b> of God has been worked out in the death of Christ to form us in the knowledge of God Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#325:25">Page 325</a>   All that is contrary to the death of Christ is exposed by the searchings, and at the same time we are formed by all that was brought out in the death of Christ, including righteousness, holiness, <b>love</b>, and truth<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#329:12">Page 329</a>  If Jesus our Lord has been delivered for our offences and raised again for our justification, it is the most blessed witness that God is for us in righteousness, grace, power and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#330:16">Page 330</a>   Would you not be assured of the <b>love</b> and favour of God?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#330:19">Page 330</a>   In deep, divine <b>love</b> he entered into death and bore the judgment of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#333:3">Page 333</a>   If we are in the light of God's <b>love</b> and purpose we shall be assured that He will care for us in the wilderness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#333:6">Page 333</a>  Joshua and Caleb did not murmur; they were in the wilderness according to God, and had true wilderness experience -- that is, experience of a faithful and forbearing <b>love</b> that never turned aside.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#333:12">Page 333</a>   He says, "Let your conversation be without <b>love</b> of money, satisfied with your present circumstances; for  he  has said, I will not leave thee, neither will I forsake thee.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#334:14">Page 334</a>  There are two things we may count on: the purpose of God and the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#334:15">Page 334</a>   God is bringing us as many sons to glory, and there is One at His right hand interceding for us in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#334:18">Page 334</a>  In the wilderness we learn the faithfulness and loving kindness of God, and the <b>love</b> of Christ which never fails.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#336:15">Page 336</a>   We have to appropriate the death of Christ as that which brings to an end all that we are, while at the same time it expresses in the most blessed way the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#336:16">Page 336</a>   We are freed from ourselves by the death of Christ that we might live in the <b>love</b> that freed us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#336:19">Page 336</a>   Not only has He come into death to remove all that we are, and to bring divine <b>love</b> into a place where we can feed upon it in the most blessed way, but He came here to bring all that is heavenly and divine within reach of our hearts in Himself that we might feed on it, and be formed by it -- that it might become the life of our souls<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#337:6">Page 337</a>   How blessed to have this well of living water springing up in the soul and carrying us in spirit and affection into the region of divine <b>love</b>, "The <b>love</b> of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord" ( Romans 8:39 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#338:6">Page 338</a>   It is not possible to be in presence of God known in grace and <b>love</b> -- in presence of the Father and the Son -- without being worshippers.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#343:9">Page 343</a>   No longer then a mere professor, making a fair show in the flesh while the soul's deep stains of sin are unremoved, you will be justified by grace, apparelled in divine righteousness, and made complete in Christ; so that if infinite holiness searches you it will be only to find that infinite <b>love</b> has removed in righteousness every stain of sin.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#346:4">Page 346</a>   He has spoken His last words of <b>love</b> to His poor sorrowing disciples, and He turns from them to His Father for a brief moment of communion in view of the cross.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#346:16">Page 346</a>   for this <b>love</b> let rocks and hills  Their lasting silence break;  And all harmonious human tongues  The Saviour's praises speak'.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#347:1">Page 347</a>   Yet this terrible ordeal only served as a dark background to show out in greater brilliancy the submission, the obedience, the devotedness, and the <b>love</b> of His heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#350:5">Page 350</a>   His <b>love</b> is better than wine, and when He looks upon us it puts gladness in our hearts that the world knows nothing of.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#350:19">Page 350</a>   You <b>love</b> the truth of God and would not surrender it for anything.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#351:8">Page 351</a>   May the Lord flood all our hearts afresh with His <b>love</b>, and thus make our cup to be constantly running as Charles Wesley's was when he wrote, over, 'My heart is full of Christ, and longs  Its glorious matter to declare!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#351:10">Page 351</a>    Fairer than all the earth-born race,  Perfect in comeliness Thou art;  Replenished are Thy lips with grace;  And full of <b>love</b> Thy tender heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#368:2">Page 368</a>   "Pursue righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#379:22">Page 379</a>  GOD'S <b>LOVE</b> LEADING TO PRAISE Isaiah 38:17  - 20 In the dealings of God with Hezekiah, God brought the weight of death on his spirit, but it was really that he might learn how God could intervene in the power of resurrection, so that he might go up on the third day to the house of Jehovah.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#380:4">Page 380</a>   Hezekiah wrote after he had recovered, "But thou hast in <b>love</b> delivered my soul from the pit of destruction", and, "Jehovah was purposed to save me" ( Isaiah 38:17 , 20).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#380:5">Page 380</a>   He learned the <b>love</b> of God at the low point to which he was brought.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#380:6">Page 380</a>  It is terrible to us naturally to realise that death is upon us as before God, but it is just there that the <b>love</b> of God is brought home to us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#380:8">Page 380</a>   For scarcely for the just man will one die, for perhaps for the good man some one might also dare to die; but God commends his <b>love</b> to us, in that, we being still sinners, Christ has died for us" ( Romans 5:6  - 8).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#380:9">Page 380</a>   The thought prominent in this scripture is not that the claims of God have been met -- that aspect of the truth is seen in the blood as put upon the mercy-seat -- but here it is that God's <b>love</b> has been expressed in Christ having died for us, and this <b>love</b> is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#380:10">Page 380</a>   The <b>love</b> of God is thus applied to us as the cake of figs was applied to Hezekiah.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#380:11">Page 380</a>   How wonderfully sweet it is to find that Christ has been into death to give expression to the <b>love</b> of God, and this is made a personal reality to each one who has the Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#380:12">Page 380</a>  Those who live by the Spirit in relation to God, as having God's <b>love</b> shed abroad in their hearts by the Spirit, know that it is in death that that <b>love</b> has reached them<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#381:5">Page 381</a>   It is as the full weight of this comes on our spirits, we are prepared to appreciate that this dreadful thing -- death -- has become in the death of Christ the expression to us of the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#381:6">Page 381</a>   The Holy Spirit delights to apply that <b>love</b> to us by shedding it abroad in our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#381:8">Page 381</a>   It is not simply that we believe that God loves us, but the Spirit pours His <b>love</b> into our hearts, and it becomes a power of life there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#381:9">Page 381</a>   We are then amongst "the living", who can praise God for His <b>love</b>, known through the death of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#382:4">Page 382</a>   The youngest should understand that we come together in assembly first of all to think of the great witness of divine <b>love</b> in the death of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#382:10">Page 382</a>   It is sorrowful to think that any believer could willingly remain away from the Lord's supper, for it is the Lord's own personal appeal of <b>love</b>, intended to rally all His own.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#387:13">Page 387</a>   If God is <b>love</b>, He can only be satisfied by <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#388:8">Page 388</a>   None of us would think of asking the Lord to <b>love</b> us more than He does!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#388:16">Page 388</a>   Then there is a sowing that has in view all the purposes of God's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#388:18">Page 388</a>   If we accept the first and humble ourselves, He falls back on His purposes and works them out in His own sovereignty and <b>love</b> from His own side, which is a great comfort.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#389:7">Page 389</a>   The overcomer is only such in sovereign <b>love</b> and mercy, and each one would own that to be so.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#389:18">Page 389</a>   Nothing has caused me more anguish than the knowledge that I was unresponsive to the <b>love</b> of Christ after all He had done and is, and that I had not the least bit of power to make myself so.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#389:20">Page 389</a>   In Romans you cannot do what you would like to, but now it is a person who has known deliverance from the law, exercised to be wholly responsive to the <b>love</b> of Christ and of God, and he finds there is not the power in him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#391:2">Page 391</a>   <b>Love</b> has gone to such lengths that it has established a righteous claim to our whole-hearted <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#391:4">Page 391</a>  In the previous section His dealings in <b>love</b> are to bring us to recognise the relationship of <b>love</b>, and say, "My husband".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#391:21">Page 391</a>   It is suitability brought about down here that corresponds with Him in the bond of <b>love</b>, with the sense of the resource there is in Him and of no need to turn anywhere else.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#392:37">Page 392</a>   We have to own the claim of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#393:29">Page 393</a>   We cannot think of God or of the Lord Jesus giving up the claim of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#395:23">Page 395</a>   That is the purpose of His dealings; and behind all His dealings is the thought of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#395:24">Page 395</a>   He means us to come into the truth of wifely relations, sonship and eternal life, and all that is bound up in His thoughts of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#395:36">Page 395</a>   "As many as I <b>love</b>, I rebuke and chasten; be zealous therefore and repent" ( Revelation 3:19 )<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#398:19">Page 398</a>   We are in that now; the Spirit is working to bring to maturity the great thoughts of God and His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#398:22">Page 398</a>   It is the climax of the book, showing the thoughts of divine <b>love</b> in their fruition.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#398:29">Page 398</a>   In the Supper we should look first to be comforted in the great thoughts of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#403:34">Page 403</a>   I think God has pictured in Jacob the whole course of His <b>love</b> to the children of Israel.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#404:20">Page 404</a>   It says of Jacob's service for Rachel that the years seemed as single days for the <b>love</b> that he bore her.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#404:23">Page 404</a>   Yes, that is just an expression of Jehovah's <b>love</b> to Israel and it is just an expression of Christ's <b>love</b> to the assembly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#404:24">Page 404</a>   I believe the Lord is serving us now in <b>love</b>, but He wants a wife.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#406:7">Page 406</a>  Redemption was wrought in divine <b>love</b> through the death and blood-shedding of Christ, so that through what He accomplished saints should have a wholly new place before God in Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#406:20">Page 406</a>   It is because the blessed God is so anxious that we should return to the full blessedness of what He is Himself as revealed in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#408:26">Page 408</a>   "I will heal their backsliding, I will <b>love</b> them freely".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#408:28">Page 408</a>   "I will <b>love</b> them freely", there is no restraint on the <b>love</b> of God, He is set at liberty to <b>love</b> them freely.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#408:32">Page 408</a>   Well, that is the character of the <b>love</b> into which we are brought.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#410:11">Page 410</a>   And the saints moving in the blessedness of all this become sources of great strength and stimulation; that is why we <b>love</b> the company of the saints, because we find strength in it and stimulation.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#418:4">Page 418</a>   There we had the amazing character of the <b>love</b> of God that cannot be turned aside.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#430:1">Page 430</a>   There is a remnant spoken of in verse 15, "Hate evil, and <b>love</b> good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that Jehovah, the God of hosts, will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#435:14">Page 435</a>   Anything else comes under God's chastening; any movement of greatness in us causes God to deal with us in chastening <b>love</b>, blessed be His name!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#436:4">Page 436</a>   He is dealing with us in view of His work -- in view of conditions suited to His <b>love</b>, the world of which His Son is the Sun and Centre.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#456:11">Page 456</a>  All God wants is three things, "To do justly, and to <b>love</b> goodness, and to walk humbly with thy God".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#456:14">Page 456</a>   -- to do justly and <b>love</b> goodness and then walk humbly with thy God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#456:19">Page 456</a>   Then as to practical life we are to do what is right, to <b>love</b> goodness and walk humbly with our God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#461:11">Page 461</a>   Forgiveness is really the basis of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#468:5">Page 468</a>   "Whom, having not seen, ye <b>love</b>" ( 1 Peter 1:8 ), and the rejoicing is in that line too.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#470:13">Page 470</a>   The Holy Spirit of God in penning these lines was thinking of the incarnation of the blessed Son of God, and all that would be accomplished by that marvellous act of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#472:25">Page 472</a>   That he does not believe on God revealed in <b>love</b> in Jesus, that very fact is his condemnation.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#493:6">Page 493</a>   It implies we have apprehended the full thought of the purpose of divine <b>love</b>, we are invested with it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#496:27">Page 496</a>   Very beautiful -- iniquity gone and brotherly <b>love</b> established (verse 10).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#519:27">Page 519</a>   It is grace, and we are not to be on the line of demand, but to walk in the <b>love</b> of the brethren.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#520:8">Page 520</a>   <b>Love</b> is the fulfilling of the law.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#520:9">Page 520</a>   You will not murder, steal, do harm, for <b>love</b> will regulate it all.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#520:12">Page 520</a>  When the Lord says to Ephesus, "I have against thee, that thou hast left thy first <b>love</b>", He is, I think, referring to activity of <b>love</b> toward the brethren; I do not know if I am right.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#520:13">Page 520</a>   "<b>Love</b> one another, as I have loved you" -- I understand that is first <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#520:17">Page 520</a>   Is that why brotherly <b>love</b> is found in Philadelphia?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#520:29">Page 520</a>   It is God's nature, He is <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#520:31">Page 520</a>   John speaks of His <b>love</b>, following on the Supper -- the giving of His body and the pouring out of His blood are the great evidence of it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#520:33">Page 520</a>   "If we <b>love</b> one another, God abides in us, and his <b>love</b> is perfected in us".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#521:4">Page 521</a>  <b>Love</b> is more connected with children than with sons.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#521:9">Page 521</a>   This is put in contrast to that which is formal and religious; it is not fasting and weeping, but brotherly <b>love</b>, so the divine nature is observed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#522:10">Page 522</a>   As they are supposed to have put on the new man the Colossians and Ephesians were marked by <b>love</b> to all saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#522:12">Page 522</a>   If they discard the old man and put on the new man we should <b>love</b> to do so; there would be no difficulty.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#525:17">Page 525</a>   Truth comes in a good deal in the epistles of John -- walking in truth, whom I <b>love</b> in truth.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#528:30">Page 528</a>   I think His coming is to do with remnant times and in such a way that only <b>love</b> will recognise Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#528:32">Page 528</a>   Only <b>love</b> could recognise Him, and it is thus that He comes to the assembly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#528:38">Page 528</a>   In both aspects He presents Himself in such a way as only <b>love</b> could recognise Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#529:2">Page 529</a>   John said, "It is the Lord", and "He that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will <b>love</b> him and will manifest myself to Him".<br>

<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#550:17">Page 550</a>   The Lord serves in <b>love</b>, and will in a sense serve eternally; and in the days of His flesh He gets no recompense.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#554:15">Page 554</a>   It is a remarkable service of His <b>love</b> to the remnant.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#562:17">Page 562</a>  God has been pleased to establish certain relations in His own sovereign <b>love</b>, and all saints are under responsibility to acknowledge the relations that God has established.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#562:27">Page 562</a>   He did not consult His people; He established things in His sovereign <b>love</b>, and by election and calling He has brought His people into those relations and responsibilities at the present time, and we are to recognise those principles and walk by them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#563:28">Page 563</a>   That means withdrawing from iniquity, fleeing youthful lusts, and following righteousness, faith, <b>love</b> and peace, with those that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#564:1">Page 564</a>   You get to Laodicea the valued words, "As many as I <b>love</b>".<br>

<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#564:4">Page 564</a>   Is it a mark of divine <b>love</b>?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#564:7">Page 564</a>   We owe everything to God's <b>love</b>, everything we have.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#564:8">Page 564</a>   It is sovereign <b>love</b> -- the <b>love</b> of election.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#564:9">Page 564</a>   God set His <b>love</b> upon us when we were dead in trespasses and sins; it ought to appeal to us very much.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#564:18">Page 564</a>   Whatever we are or have is of God's sovereign <b>love</b>, it is of His calling.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#564:21">Page 564</a>   If we realised God had called us in <b>love</b> to a certain position and service, we should be greatly interested to fill it to His satisfaction.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#564:23">Page 564</a>  If God has established certain conditions in sovereign <b>love</b>, and if we realise that otherwise only certain perdition awaited us and that we owe everything to His sovereignty, it imposes a responsibility to approach God in a way that is satisfying to His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#564:27">Page 564</a>   It is a necessity to God's <b>love</b> that we approach Him in a way satisfactory to Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#564:29">Page 564</a>   If sustained in His <b>love</b> it will always be a right offering.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#564:34">Page 564</a>   Their offerings showed this insensibility to Jehovah's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#565:7">Page 565</a>   I was wondering if it would indicate the special character of the <b>love</b>, <b>love</b> connected with choice -- a selective <b>love</b> in that way -- expressing in a way the special position that the saints have in God's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#565:11">Page 565</a>   We have come under the sovereign <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#565:12">Page 565</a>   We owe everything to that -- our place in the body, the house, the wife -- it is all a matter of the sovereign disposal of God's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#566:9">Page 566</a>    Romans 1  - 8 unfolds God's <b>love</b> and chapter 9 shows it all to be a matter of God's sovereignty.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#575:4">Page 575</a>   All these conditions are established in holiness; God has called us in holiness, and if we have got away from that character, we have got away from the character of the dispensation, away from holiness, away from grace and <b>love</b>; and all moral breakdown springs from getting away from grace and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#576:14">Page 576</a>   Until the moment of final rejection we can count on the Lord's service of <b>love</b> to all those who are professedly His people.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#576:17">Page 576</a>   If He washed their feet, it was a tender service of <b>love</b>, and it did not contemplate that they were in a bad condition.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#576:19">Page 576</a>   But it is still the service of <b>love</b>, as He says to Laodicea, "I rebuke and discipline as many as I <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#578:12">Page 578</a>   "Refiner's fire" and "fullers' lye" -- both are very drastic measures of purifying and cleansing, and the <b>love</b> of Christ makes Him jealous and this severe process is necessary.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac30.htm#580:33">Page 580</a>   Jehovah said, "I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the <b>love</b> of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness" ( Jeremiah 2:2 ).<br>
<h3>Volume 31 - Miscellaneous Ministry on the New Testament Matthew-Romans</h3>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#3:15">Page 3</a>   The death of the Son of God is the mighty voice of divine <b>love</b> to man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#3:16">Page 3</a>   The ruin, need, guilt, and condemnation of man, the sinner, only serve as the dark background to show in stronger light the <b>love</b> that would reach him and bless him in spite of it all<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#5:13">Page 5</a>   But there are hearts that thrill with joy in the sense of His blessedness and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#5:16">Page 5</a>   It is infinitely better to be the smallest, feeblest babe and to perceive the greatness and glory and <b>love</b> of Christ than to be the most honoured person in the world without any appreciation of Him<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#7:1">Page 7</a>   These scriptures are in my mind as standing in connection with what we have been reminded of lately -- the importance of <b>love</b> to our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#7:5">Page 7</a>   And if we were sure it was exactly like what He was outwardly, it would not supply any ground of <b>love</b> to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#7:6">Page 7</a>   There is no genuine <b>love</b> to the Lord Jesus except as we apprehend what He is inwardly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#7:12">Page 7</a>   He brought those things here in His heart, so that men might know them, and He lived in them; and if we do not <b>love</b> Him in that character, we can hardly be said to <b>love</b> Him at all.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#7:13">Page 7</a>   That is, to <b>love</b> the Lord as He is, we need to see Him in relation to His Father.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#8:3">Page 8</a>   I shall never <b>love</b> Him until I know that.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#8:4">Page 8</a>   Gratitude in the heart of a believer for what He has done for him often does not go far; it very often stops short of <b>love</b> to Himself, to His own Person, and has very little separating effect from the world.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#8:5">Page 8</a>   But if we <b>love</b> Him in relation to the Father we cannot avoid being separated from the world which knows nothing of the Father, who is altogether in separation from the world.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#8:6">Page 8</a>   Indeed, John says, "If any one <b>love</b> the world, the <b>love</b> of the Father is not in him; because all that is in the world .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#8:10">Page 8</a>   Jesus as a Boy of twelve was absorbed in His Father's things, and in that character He becomes an object of <b>love</b> to His own; He is carrying in His heart the secret of all the grace of God for men.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#8:11">Page 8</a>   If we <b>love</b> Him in that character, it shows we have apprehended the Father's things.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#8:17">Page 8</a>   Those who do <b>love</b> Him in that character have done with the wretched, worthless things of the world.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#8:22">Page 8</a>   We have to <b>love</b> Him in that character as the righteous One, and so we must take on the same character.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#8:23">Page 8</a>   I cannot <b>love</b> something in Him and go on with just the opposite.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#9:2">Page 9</a>   Many believers are hung up for many years because they are not in the path of righteousness; they think they <b>love</b> the Lord but they do not.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#9:4">Page 9</a>   So that <b>love</b> for the Lord Jesus is a very practical thing, it adjusts us at every turn.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#9:17">Page 9</a>   And we <b>love</b> Him if we apprehend Him in that character.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#9:18">Page 9</a>   Then we must take on that character -- <b>love</b> will surely go His way -- and it will make its practical impression on us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#9:24">Page 9</a>   Now this is the Person we <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#10:1">Page 10</a>   No one could <b>love</b> the Lord Jesus Christ and not be a worshipper, for He is the true Worshipper.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#10:4">Page 10</a>   So that genuine <b>love</b> for the Lord Jesus Christ would transform us and fashion us in moral correspondence with Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#10:9">Page 10</a>  These words are the setting forth of all that He is inwardly, and as we see and appreciate Him in this way, we take on the character of the One we <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#12:3">Page 12</a>   Naturally we do not care for the kind of importance which being the subjects of <b>love</b> would give us; naturally we want some other kind of dignity or importance.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#14:27">Page 14</a>   Peter says, "For he that will <b>love</b> life and see good days, let him cause his tongue to cease from evil and his lips that they speak no guile" ( 1 Peter 3:10 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#16:10">Page 16</a>   I suppose because the recovered one has given occasion for peculiar activities of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#16:12">Page 16</a>   you would expend a great deal of labour and exercise of <b>love</b> on that soul; and when it was recovered you would have more joy in that one than in the others, because of the peculiar intensity of exercise which you have had about that one, and not about the others.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#21:7">Page 21</a>   Then the apostle had to write them another letter to tell them to confirm their <b>love</b> of him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#23:10">Page 23</a>  Now it certainly appears to me that a public disregard of the Lord's authority, and of the rights and claims of His <b>love</b>, is not less serious than a sin against a brother.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#23:14">Page 23</a>   How the Lord regards neglect of this institution of <b>love</b> we may gather from the serious consequences which followed upon the neglect of the passover ( Numbers 9 )<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#24:7">Page 24</a>   We are to withdraw from what is unrighteous, and to follow righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#33:5">Page 33</a>   Perfect righteousness, fulness of joy in the knowledge of the <b>love</b> of God, and all the harvest of the land of divine purpose in a heavenly Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#33:9">Page 33</a>   We have to stretch out our hand towards Him as owning that He alone can supply the ability to honour God by appropriating what His grace and <b>love</b> have provided.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#33:10">Page 33</a>   The apostle Paul puts it very beautiful when he says, "The grace of our Lord surpassingly over-abounded with faith and <b>love</b>, which is in Christ Jesus" ( 1 Timothy 1:14 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#33:11">Page 33</a>   The faith and the <b>love</b> have come from Him, and they are in Christ Jesus.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#33:17">Page 33</a>   "Faith and <b>love</b> which are in Christ Jesus" is also in  2 Timothy 1:13 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#36:6">Page 36</a>   The One who was entitled to Israel's affections had come to win them by His service of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#36:13">Page 36</a>   There must be a new garment to suit the Bridegroom -- to suit the One who serves in <b>love</b> and who wins the bride that way; she must be clothed with His worth, for nothing would suit His eye or His heart but that.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#40:5">Page 40</a>   He went out of that condition through death, making known His own <b>love</b> and the <b>love</b> of God in a still deeper way than could have been known while the Bridegroom was here, but He will resume His relations with Israel in a new way in the kingdom of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#43:15">Page 43</a>   Perfect righteousness, full joy in the <b>love</b> of God, a wonderful harvest of God's thoughts in connection with a heavenly Christ, but how far are we in the good of it?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#45:11">Page 45</a>   It is great grace on His part to be here, that in all our conscious inability to appropriate all that <b>love</b> has provided, we can stretch out our hand to be restored as we sit here.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#45:19">Page 45</a>   with faith and <b>love</b>, which is in Christ Jesus" ( 1 Timothy 1:12 , 14).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#46:2">Page 46</a>   "But the grace of our Lord surpassingly overabounded with faith and <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#46:4">Page 46</a>   There is every defect on our side, but virtue in Christ has brought in faith and <b>love</b> on our side.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#60:23">Page 60</a>   When we come to that ground we are universal in our affections, so that as regards the Colossians and Ephesians, Paul thanks God because he has heard of their <b>love</b> to all the saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#60:24">Page 60</a>   <b>Love</b> cannot be limited to what is local.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#75:17">Page 75</a>   How He would <b>love</b> to answer that question!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#83:3">Page 83</a>   He falls in <b>love</b> with what He sees in Christ; he has started now with the will of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#84:9">Page 84</a>   Only as in the power of the kingdom can I be "last of all, and minister of all", as a little child in the arms of Jesus, conscious of being in the <b>love</b> of Christ and bringing the affections of Christ with me.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#89:13">Page 89</a>   The <b>love</b> in which Christ bore the judgment becomes the nourishment of those who believe; they eat the lamb roast with fire.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#89:14">Page 89</a>   That in itself is a great apprehension of Christ; it brings us to true self-judgment, for it is the evidence that all that attached to us, as in the flesh, was of such a character that it called for the judgment of God, but the spotless One has come under the judgment and been sacrificed for us, and the <b>love</b> in which He did so is food for our hearts<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#93:7">Page 93</a>   Taking and eating in an inward and spiritual sense would be necessary as a preparation for rightly remembering the Lord, and announcing His death, as those who <b>love</b> Him and who feel His absence here.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#93:9">Page 93</a>   It secures righteously the setting up of relations between God and His people which give satisfaction to His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#93:11">Page 93</a>   God found fault with the first covenant because it did not make His <b>love</b> known to His people, and it did not set them before Him in suitability to His <b>love</b> or in response to it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#93:12">Page 93</a>   But "the covenant" -- it is doubtful whether "new" should be in Mark or Matthew, though it is in Luke -- now makes known the <b>love</b> of God in its fulness, for it is in the blood of His own Son.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#93:13">Page 93</a>   God has revealed Himself in the blessedness of His nature; He yearned to be known in His <b>love</b>, and that not by a few, but by "many"<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#94:3">Page 94</a>   He will work in them by a thousand exercises, stripping them of every bit of self-complacency and self-confidence, emptying them of everything that they have trusted in, or thought of value, but this is all that they may acquire ability by His own work to appreciate His <b>love</b> and respond to it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#94:7">Page 94</a>   It is a drinking of the <b>love</b> of God such as could not really be apart from the gift of the Holy Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#94:8">Page 94</a>   The <b>love</b> of God known as a rich and cheering draught making glad the heart as He is known there in the blessedness of His holy <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#94:10">Page 94</a>   The knowledge of God in <b>love</b> comes into the hearts of "many", and becomes the living power of the covenant bond which binds His people to Him in an unalterable way.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#94:12">Page 94</a>   As drinking of one Spirit the saints are possessed of divine <b>love</b>; they have it in themselves; and this becomes the spring in their hearts from which such features develop as are described in  1 Corinthians 13 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#94:13">Page 94</a>  But we are possessed of <b>love</b> as having found it in God, and as having drunk into it through the death of His Son, so that what is witnessed in the blood of Christ has a real place with us inwardly by the Holy Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#95:2">Page 95</a>   How blessed to drink into the <b>love</b> which is the spring of all in the heart of God!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#96:2">Page 96</a>   But the full revelation of His <b>love</b> could only come out through the death to which all was leading.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#97:14">Page 97</a>   He has joy in His own as blessed in Himself, and blessed in the knowledge of God as revealed in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#97:17">Page 97</a>   In thinking of the joy which we have in drinking of the cup of the covenant, let us not forget His drinking -- the joy which He has in His saints as blessed according to the pleasure of God in Him, and as made to drink into the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#98:10">Page 98</a>   Our Lord and Head is joyous; He has brought to pass the pleasure of God, and revealed the <b>love</b> of God, and on His side He has set His saints in the blessedness of this.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#99:9">Page 99</a>   They are in the kingdom of His Father; they have learned to know God as Christ's Father, and to know Him in the liberty of the Spirit of sonship, but also in the rule and discipline of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#99:11">Page 99</a>   Those in that kingdom have not only received sonship through infinite divine favour and <b>love</b> according to  Galatians 4:4  - 7, but they have known the instruction and correction of sons under the Father's disciplinary rule.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#104:22">Page 104</a>   How we <b>love</b> the manger!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#110:21">Page 110</a>   The gift of the Spirit, as announced in the glad tidings, becomes the subject of faith; that is, we come to it in the faith of our hearts that it is in the mind and <b>love</b> of God to give us His Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#114:7">Page 114</a>   Hence the apostle prayed that we might be "strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man; that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts, being rooted and founded in <b>love</b>, in order that ye may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height" ( Ephesians 3:16  - 18).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#118:6">Page 118</a>   We learn first how such a Man as Jesus lives, and then how such a Man worships and serves; and next we see the perfect way in which such a Man confides in the known <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#121:9">Page 121</a>  The third temptation brings out the restful assurance of divine <b>love</b> in which the Lord Jesus was kept while here below.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#121:12">Page 121</a>   The great danger is that we may be like the Jews desiring a sign; when the Lord was here, they came to Him asking for signs, and it is very often Satan's way to want us to acquire some evidence that God really does <b>love</b> and care for us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#121:13">Page 121</a>   Christ is our evidence, and we do not want evidence of the <b>love</b> and care of the blessed God other than Christ.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#122:20">Page 122</a>   The kingdom of God is composed of those who <b>love</b> Jesus and minister to Him; and no power of evil can touch that<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#123:1">Page 123</a>   Evil is completely displaced in those who appreciate and <b>love</b> Jesus, and are engaged in ministering to Him.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#124:11">Page 124</a>   It is not working for Him -- Christendom is full of the idea of working for Him -- we can work for Him and be as legal as the day is long, but we can only minister to Him in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#124:19">Page 124</a>   He never had the privilege of washing the feet of Jesus and anointing them; it was not given to John in the wisdom and counsel of God, but it was given to the woman and it is given to us if we have the <b>love</b> to take it up.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#127:4">Page 127</a>   As to the real power of the thing, it is not only what we know of Scripture, or the path of outward separation, but what tells is that Jesus is loved and ministered to; and His heart is gratified by what He finds in those who <b>love</b> Him -- that is the kingdom of God in power.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#127:8">Page 127</a>   Would <b>love</b> be the keeping of His commandments?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#127:13">Page 127</a>   People say they <b>love</b> the Lord, and are very busy working for Him, but the test would be, have they got the twelve?<br>

<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#215:4">Page 215</a>   It must be so, because <b>love</b> in a father is conjoined with authority.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#216:17">Page 216</a>   So that the result will be in full answer to the original thought of divine <b>love</b> before the foundation of the world.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#223:7">Page 223</a>   I believe it is peculiarly sweet to the Lord to be called to mind in a way that brings so definitely before us the supreme act of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#223:9">Page 223</a>   It brought out the measureless character of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#224:2">Page 224</a>   The Supper is not only the sweet and holy privilege vouchsafed by <b>love</b> to <b>love</b>, but it is a divine call to self-judgment.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#224:8">Page 224</a>   But in presence of that which speaks of the body and blood of the Lord all this is deeply and truly judged and the Lord gets His place with us as known in the supremacy of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#224:9">Page 224</a>   We realise, too, that the Lord is not here, and that He is not wanted here, but we <b>love</b> Him and we do the act which He instituted in remembrance of Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#225:2">Page 225</a>   It was the last act in a companionship that had been sweet to His heart; He had made them conscious of His <b>love</b> to them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#225:3">Page 225</a>   He could say, "As I have loved you, that ye also <b>love</b> one another" ( John 13:34 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#225:6">Page 225</a>   It was <b>love</b>'s desire, for <b>love</b> must have the company of its objects.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#226:2">Page 226</a>   We should thus stand in obedience and affectionate relation to the Lord, and to the brethren who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#227:9">Page 227</a>   Then the Lord has His personal joy in coming to those whom He loves, and who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#230:15">Page 230</a>   He has taken a precious holy body; He has come into a condition marked by obedience, so that He might take up, in the obedience of <b>love</b>, all that is in the will of God in regard to us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#231:23">Page 231</a>   Then the Hebrew bondman has his ear bored and continues in obedience through <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#232:12">Page 232</a>   We see in Christ the way that divine <b>love</b> has operated, so that everything originates in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#232:13">Page 232</a>   It is <b>love</b> on God's part and on the part of Christ, divine <b>love</b>, but <b>love</b> moving on the line of obedience.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#233:9">Page 233</a>  That Person has been devoted in <b>love</b> to us even to death, and it moves our hearts to their very depths that a divine Person should become Man and be devoted in <b>love</b> to us to the fullest possible extent.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#234:16">Page 234</a>   Do you think it would be possible, if all the saints were together in the way which you have been suggesting, that we should reach the point in which His <b>love</b> would be predominant?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#234:19">Page 234</a>   Yes, I think the whole point of the institution is that divine <b>love</b> dominates -- the <b>love</b> of Christ, a divine Person; He has become Man that He might give His body for us, and then He says, "This cup is the new covenant".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#237:7">Page 237</a>   Nobody could do it as He did, and so we <b>love</b> to think of Him breaking the bread.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#238:1">Page 238</a>   The very fact that He took a loaf and a cup shows that in the wisdom of divine <b>love</b> there is no better means of our being collectively enabled to call Him to mind.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#239:11">Page 239</a>   He was there in His matchless <b>love</b>, and it touches and captivates our hearts to know that He was there, but the assembly does not know Him there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#241:13">Page 241</a>   And so He gives us personal touches in order to bring us to the assembly -- He makes His saints conscious that they have part in His life, and so are suitable to be led into all those thoughts of divine <b>love</b> that are known in the assembly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#243:12">Page 243</a>   But it requires that those who <b>love</b> Him in every locality where His name is called upon should be unified in doing it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#243:28">Page 243</a>   It is the appeal of the Lord to all that <b>love</b> Him, and if listened to would practically unify all the saints in every place.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#245:11">Page 245</a>   The death of Christ gives the right basis for everything and conveys the impress of the <b>love</b> of Christ to our hearts, carrying captive our affections, and displacing all expectations from the scene in which He died.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#246:16">Page 246</a>   That calls attention to Himself as the One whose mighty hands had carried into effect all the purposes of the Father's <b>love</b>; those purposes are only carried out and brought to pass in the power of the blood and water which flowed from His side, which effected not only complete expiation but also purification.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#252:20">Page 252</a>  If you think of all the wealth that divine <b>love</b> has bestowed upon the assembly, you will realise that only a little part can be touched on one occasion, and the question is what part of it the Lord will enable us to touch on any particular Lord's Day morning.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#253:4">Page 253</a>   It suggests to my mind a private movement which belongs to the intimacy of <b>love</b> to prepare the disciples for the public position.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#254:13">Page 254</a>   The Lord intended His supper as a provision of His <b>love</b> for us to lead us on to  John 12 , but in Bethany they made Him a supper; He was manifestly the pre-eminent One there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#264:13">Page 264</a>  But on His side what perfect grace and <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#264:16">Page 264</a>   The black tide of man's wickedness rose to its flood, but it was met by the deep, full, glorious tide of divine grace, <b>love</b> and sovereign mercy.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#264:19">Page 264</a>   Every question has been raised and settled in divine righteousness and <b>love</b> to the glory of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#265:11">Page 265</a>   If you look at that risen Man you will see what can never crumble away -- all the blessings of God's grace and the thoughts of His <b>love</b> established in One who is alive for evermore.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#267:3">Page 267</a>   Thank Him for it, and in the presence of His grace and <b>love</b> you will see what a fool you have been, and you will most deeply judge and loathe yourself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#267:21">Page 267</a>   If Christ has got possession of us and His <b>love</b> holds us fast, to speak of Him will be the natural outflow of our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#275:3">Page 275</a>   Because we are sons, God has sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, "Abba, Father" ( Galatians 4:6 ;  Romans 8:15 ); He sheds God's <b>love</b> abroad in our hearts ( Romans 5:5 ); He makes our bodies His temple ( 1 Corinthians 6:19 ); He abides with us for ever, sealing us unto the day of redemption ( John 14:16 ;  Ephesians 4:30 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#284:6">Page 284</a>   Man the sinner was there -- Christ has come in the likeness of sinful flesh and gone into death to bear his condemnation and to put him out of God's sight, not only in holy judgment but in holy <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#284:8">Page 284</a>   How near this brings the <b>love</b> of God to us when we see the way He has taken to set us aside so that He might fill us with the blessedness of Another, and that His own beloved Son!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#284:9">Page 284</a>   To know the <b>love</b> of God we must look at the cross.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#285:3">Page 285</a>  , but speak of Christ -- of His <b>love</b>, His death, His resurrection, His glory -- and there is no response; you find you are not wanted.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#286:2">Page 286</a>   He has entered as Man into all that is spoken of in  1 Corinthians 2:9 , 10 as "things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that <b>love</b> him, but God has revealed to us by his Spirit".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#288:17">Page 288</a>   The voice of His <b>love</b> says, "This do in remembrance of me".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#288:19">Page 288</a>   If we do so we shall surely regard the Lord's supper as an institution of the highest importance, for it is that which puts us in a special way in presence of His <b>love</b>, and which brings us together as those who <b>love</b> one another<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#289:1">Page 289</a>   We do not break bread as an ordinance, or as a means of grace, but in response of heart to the voice of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#289:3">Page 289</a>   We meet our brethren there in the presence of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#289:4">Page 289</a>   We are brought together in the holy unity of the <b>love</b> of Christ for the remembrance of Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#291:9">Page 291</a>   Driven from the world, and drawn to each other, by the constraint of common sorrows and joys, believers were found together in the blessed exercise and experience of brotherly <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#292:15">Page 292</a>   Believers were linked together by a bond of holy <b>love</b> which made each one glad to forget himself in ministering to the need of others.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#293:4">Page 293</a>   The first sign of failure was a failure in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#294:20">Page 294</a>   Nevertheless He speaks to them as a "fallen" assembly because they had forsaken their first <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#296:11">Page 296</a>  The Son of God has brought a most blessed testimony into this world: the revelation of God in supreme grace and <b>love</b> -- the Father.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#309:9">Page 309</a>   But if a brother or a sister can speak of Christ and of the Father's <b>love</b> in power, that is indisputable evidence of the presence of the Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#313:5">Page 313</a>   In the previous chapter God was known to be in His assembly by the fruits of grace and <b>love</b> and unity that came out in His people.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#313:26">Page 313</a>   There was the action of unselfish <b>love</b>; those who had possessions sold them and they distributed to all who had need; there was most blessed evidence that God was amongst His people.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#318:1">Page 318</a>   These two imitated what others were doing in the power of the Holy Spirit in pure unselfish <b>love</b>; they did the same thing, but self-interest was the only thing that governed them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#318:20">Page 318</a>   There was an answer in  Acts 4  to what God desired in the law, that man should <b>love</b> God and his neighbour; and Ananias and Sapphira would give the appearance of doing it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#319:32">Page 319</a>   They had been spoken to by what was going on amongst the brethren, this beautiful unselfish spirit of <b>love</b> that was in activity among the brethren; and though with them there was nothing but selfishness working in an empty heart, they tried to imitate the conduct of those whose hearts were filled with God, and so they fell into the hands of Satan.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#339:5">Page 339</a>   But we have always found, and shall find, that the one who searches is the One who supports, and He teaches us that we can only follow righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace, as calling upon Him out of a pure heart; that is, He alone is our resource and strength.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#347:20">Page 347</a>  And now we come to the seventh and last feature in regard of these believers, the beautiful care that was found with them, the spirit of <b>love</b> in caring for needs far beyond their own bounds (verses 29, 30), their "free-hearted liberality" ( 2 Corinthians 8:2 ).<br>

<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#370:20">Page 370</a>   What answers to "the residue of these nations" is the influence of persons who are not governed by <b>love</b> to God and by what is spiritual; therefore it is of the greatest importance that we should preserve purity in our associations.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#371:1">Page 371</a>   We are apt to forget that influences which rob us of the enjoyment of God's <b>love</b> often operate through nice, attractive people, not through drunkards, thieves, or immoral persons.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#372:14">Page 372</a>  We have a witness before us every week in the Supper that God has committed Himself to us in <b>love</b> -- a <b>love</b> expressed in the death of Christ: that is what the cup of the new covenant means.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#372:21">Page 372</a>  PAUL'S VOYAGE AS SUGGESTIVE OF CHURCH HISTORY Acts 27:1  - 44 In verses 2 and 3 of this chapter we get a hint of the happy conditions which were found in the assembly when it was marked by the work of faith, the labour of <b>love</b> and the enduring constancy of hope<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#373:4">Page 373</a>  ) In those days of first <b>love</b> the saints were characteristically Paul's friends, and there was much "consolation of <b>love</b>" amongst them and refreshment of heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#374:17">Page 374</a>   For example, we may conclude that all was in outward order at Ephesus ( Revelation 2 ) though first <b>love</b> had been left<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#377:3">Page 377</a>   It was lost in sacramentalism for many centuries, but it has been revived and it seems to indicate a special activity of the <b>love</b> of Christ just before, and in view of, the end.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#377:4">Page 377</a>   It is wonderful that such a precious and divine rallying-point should have been restored, and that the saints should be exercised to get away from all sacramental and formal ideas, and to enter into what the Supper was in the heart and mind of the Lord Jesus when He instituted it, and all that He intended it to be to them as the witness of His <b>love</b>, and the answer to that <b>love</b> -- so deeply valued by Him -- on their part.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#377:7">Page 377</a>   The breaking of bread and thanksgiving to God go together, and both are revived in the power of divine <b>love</b> just before the end.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#389:22">Page 389</a>  It says in  2 Corinthians 5:14  - 18, "For the <b>love</b> of the Christ constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died; and he died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#403:5">Page 403</a>   But if the sinless One has died for the whole race under sin, His <b>love</b> has established a claim upon all.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#403:6">Page 403</a>   Not only has their true state been set forth in His having died for them, but divine <b>love</b> to men has been manifested in a most wondrous way.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#407:11">Page 407</a>   What was due to the creature under sin has come upon the sinless Son of God who bore it in <b>love</b>, but who has come out of it as risen to be the salvation; the righteousness and the life of every one who believes the good news.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#416:2">Page 416</a>   We read of <b>love</b> in incorruption at the end of Ephesians.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#416:3">Page 416</a>   If we <b>love</b> our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibility we are marked by affections that are of an unchanging and imperishable order.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#416:14">Page 416</a>   ( Hymn 76 ) Every trial and testing casts us upon God, and we find God pledged to us in <b>love</b>, and as we learn Him thus we are formed in the divine nature, and we come into correspondence with Him<br>

<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#417:2">Page 417</a>   Holiness and <b>love</b> pertain to the divine nature.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#430:14">Page 430</a>   It does make you <b>love</b> God when you see the kind of Person He has brought in!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#431:1">Page 431</a>  It is not God who has told us that He is <b>love</b>; God has left us to work out for ourselves that He is <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#431:2">Page 431</a>   It is John who says, "God is <b>love</b>" ( 1 John 4:16 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#431:5">Page 431</a>   The way that He has brought in His righteousness is so convincing that you cannot get away from the conclusion that "God is <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#431:6">Page 431</a>   You are convinced of it -- God's <b>love</b> is the only thing in which God is not sufficient for Himself -- <b>love</b> must have objects.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#431:7">Page 431</a>   The <b>love</b> of God comes to light in this: we find there is that in God that, for His own satisfaction, He must be possessed of me; we are a necessity to God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#432:19">Page 432</a>   It is the way that God has set Himself free so that we know Him in the blessed movements of His <b>love</b>, the motive nature of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#433:1">Page 433</a>  ; His motive nature is <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#433:3">Page 433</a>   It is His <b>love</b> that moves Him; He moves at the dictates of His <b>love</b>, consistently with His moral nature.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#434:8">Page 434</a>  You know what to expect from God because His <b>love</b> (the same as that expressed in the death of Christ) is diffused in your heart by the Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#434:14">Page 434</a>   God has dealt with it in His <b>love</b> in the death of His Son.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#441:19">Page 441</a>   And hope in God will never let us down, for the Holy Spirit has been given to us to shed abroad the <b>love</b> of God in our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#441:24">Page 441</a>   How He sheds the <b>love</b> of God abroad is by bringing the death of Christ before us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#442:15">Page 442</a>   At all cost to His own <b>love</b> He would remove the distance and it was really by removing the man who was the enemy.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#442:26">Page 442</a>   The Lord's table and His supper are in His administration of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#444:19">Page 444</a>   Indeed he is marked by <b>love</b> which fulfils the law.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#460:12">Page 460</a>   If we do not know the righteousness of God thus, there can be no solid peace, and no true enjoyment of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#461:2">Page 461</a>   We need to have the truth of this deeply laid in our souls in these days when men have such loose and human thoughts of mercy, grace and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#461:5">Page 461</a>   If men speak or think of the <b>love</b> of God in such a way as to lose sight of the reality of His wrath, they hold the truth in unrighteousness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#461:6">Page 461</a>   The fact is that His <b>love</b> is known through His beloved Son having come as Man to drink the awful cup of atoning sorrows, and to bear the wrath due to unrighteousness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#471:30">Page 471</a>   It has been said that God is revealed in these early chapters in righteousness, in power and in <b>love</b>, and His power is revealed in the resurrection of Christ and becomes available to every poor sinner that realises he is as good as dead.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#473:6">Page 473</a>   I used to think Paul ought to have put in a chapter here to say how the Spirit is received, but what he is doing is building up the soul of man, so that there should be something built up there for the Spirit to recognise, and he drops on us all at once by saying, "The <b>love</b> of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#474:1">Page 474</a>   It has been said, God is sufficient for Himself in everything, excepting His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#474:2">Page 474</a>   God's <b>love</b> would not let Him rest.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#481:14">Page 481</a>  "The <b>love</b> of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#481:15">Page 481</a>   It brings before us the delight of the Spirit of God to make us conscious of the <b>love</b> of God by bringing before us the death of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#481:25">Page 481</a>   We cannot think that the blessed God ever forgets -- it is the death of His Son; and if we are moving in fellowship with God the death of Christ has an increasing place with us, and the Spirit of God would use it to give us a profound sense of the <b>love</b> of God<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#482:3">Page 482</a>   It is not so much the thought of sacrifice here as an expression of the perfection of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#485:4">Page 485</a>   We need to have peace with God and to know His great favourableness towards us before the Spirit is free to shed abroad in our hearts the <b>love</b> of God (verse 5).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#485:6">Page 485</a>   We need to be justified and brought into peace and to understand the great favourableness of God toward us first before we can have His <b>love</b> shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#486:23">Page 486</a>   God justifies us that He might give us the Spirit, so that we might set aside the flesh and have the <b>love</b> of God shed abroad in our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#486:30">Page 486</a>   But in chapter 5: 5 the Spirit is doing His delightful work, shedding the <b>love</b> of God abroad in our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#487:6">Page 487</a>   <b>Love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#487:25">Page 487</a>   His presence would occupy you with God: "The <b>love</b> of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#490:3">Page 490</a>   If the <b>love</b> of God is shed abroad in your heart, that is good experience; it is something brought about that is very blessed, it is a heart experience.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#493:11">Page 493</a>   The <b>love</b> of God comes first, then reconciliation; is that the order?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#493:18">Page 493</a>   The shedding abroad of the <b>love</b> of God in our hearts gives us desires Godward.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#493:22">Page 493</a>   "Reconciled to God through the death of his Son" shows how divine <b>love</b> enters into the matter; that is, the <b>love</b> of God did not stop short of any cost, that He might have His creature near to Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#494:20">Page 494</a>   In the assembly we speak of Christ and of the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#495:26">Page 495</a>   We begin to see that the Lord Jesus Christ is the peculiar divine avenue through whom all the pure divine grace and thoughts of <b>love</b> have come, that have flowed out to us; He is the blessed Administrator of it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#495:27">Page 495</a>   So we see Him glorious, as the One making God known in the full measure of all His thoughts of <b>love</b> for us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#497:13">Page 497</a>   Raven said that the <b>love</b> of God is the last thing we learn; well, I am glad to be in a spot where I can learn it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#511:17">Page 511</a>   The Father's <b>love</b> embraces Him and takes Him out.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#522:35">Page 522</a>   It is the bondage of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#528:18">Page 528</a>  Then, thirdly, we learn that the death of Christ is not only our way out of all that we are morally as in the flesh, but it is our way into the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#528:19">Page 528</a>   Christ has come into death that He might open an eternal well-spring of divine <b>love</b> for our hearts, so that we might live in that <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#529:1">Page 529</a>   He came from Godhead's fullest glory down to the dust of death that He might give expression to all the depths of God's nature, and place the <b>love</b> of God within reach of the appropriation of our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#529:2">Page 529</a>   The Spirit energises us in the inward man for the appropriation of that <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#529:4">Page 529</a>   It is by the Spirit we have life in us -- that capacity to know divine <b>love</b>, so as to live in it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#530:15">Page 530</a>  In  Romans 8  we are looked at as being in Christ Jesus, and as having received the Spirit, so that we may walk after the Spirit, and know the <b>love</b> of God so as to <b>love</b> Him in response.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#530:17">Page 530</a>   When Paul says, "Who shall separate us from the <b>love</b> of Christ?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#530:18">Page 530</a>  ", it is clearly the <b>love</b> of Christ as Priest that is before him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#530:19">Page 530</a>   How blessed to know that not all the power of evil without can separate us from the <b>love</b> of the Priest!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#530:21">Page 530</a>   Instead of pressure here coming in between our hearts and the <b>love</b> of Christ it only furnishes an opportunity for that <b>love</b> to be more active on our behalf<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#531:2">Page 531</a>  The object of Christ's priestly intercession is that our hearts may be kept in the knowledge and joy of the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#531:3">Page 531</a>   The effect of His intercession is that we are persuaded that nothing "shall be able to separate us from the <b>love</b> of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#531:4">Page 531</a>   Christ came down from the top to the bottom to open for us, in His own precious death, the springs of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#531:5">Page 531</a>   He has now gone back from the bottom to the top as a risen and glorified Man to intercede for us that we may not be moved away from those springs of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#531:13">Page 531</a>   Human influences and motives did not rule him; circumstances did not control him; he lived in the light of the Son of God, as bound to Him by the <b>love</b> in which that blessed One had given Himself for him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#532:11">Page 532</a>   An act of sovereign <b>love</b> has put us in Him, and in order that we may have the consciousness of this God has given us the Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#533:13">Page 533</a>   If we accepted death to everything that is morally characteristic of the world and of our old man, we should really want death in the Jordan aspect as our way into association with Him in life and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#533:14">Page 533</a>   Romans shows how we are  brought out  of the circle of darkness and lust and death; but Colossians opens up the way in which we are  brought in  to a wondrous circle of light and <b>love</b> as quickened together with Christ and risen with Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#534:12">Page 534</a>   All that is needed on our side is hearts responsive to Him and to the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#538:32">Page 538</a>   This chapter speaks of the righteous requirement of the law being fulfilled in us; the Christian fulfils what is right because he walks in <b>love</b>, <b>love</b> is the whole law (chapter 13: 10).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#540:12">Page 540</a>   The apostle could exhort Timothy to follow righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace, etc.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#546:5">Page 546</a>   The two thoughts particularly before me are the <b>love</b> of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord, and the <b>love</b> of Christ in which He intercedes for us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#546:8">Page 546</a>  In Christ as the Ark of the covenant, the <b>love</b> of God is now in the Man who delighted to do His will; it is, at the present moment, in the heart of a risen and glorified Man who has accomplished everything that was in the will of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#546:9">Page 546</a>   There is nothing to interfere with the <b>love</b> of God resting on Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#546:10">Page 546</a>   We begin by thinking of the <b>love</b> of God in relation to us, but it is "in Christ Jesus our Lord".<br>

<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#579:3">Page 579</a>   All the wonderful things which God has bestowed on us -- the gift of the Spirit, salvation, eternal life, the children's place, sonship, the inheritance -- these are the greatest things in Scripture: and yet they are all the gift of the <b>love</b> of God, given because God would give them and nothing else would suit His mind.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#579:4">Page 579</a>   So the greatest things are, in a sense, common to all saints, by the gift of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#583:9">Page 583</a>   He is there to shed the <b>love</b> of God abroad in our hearts (chapter 5), and He is there to lead us into sonship, "As many as are led by the Spirit of God,  these  are sons of God" (chapter 8: 14).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#586:24">Page 586</a>  There are many other things -- the <b>love</b> of God, the <b>love</b> of Christ -- many different powerful influences brought to bear.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#587:3">Page 587</a>   It was once seen in the Lord Jesus, a blessed Man in absolute dependence, who was here only for the will of God, supported from heaven, directed from heaven, knowing His place in the <b>love</b> of God and living in it -- the kingdom of God was seen there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#593:5">Page 593</a>   "The <b>love</b> of the Spirit" (verse 30) -- does it refer to it in the saints, or as a divine Person?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#593:8">Page 593</a>   My own impression is it refers to the <b>love</b> that the Spirit produced in the hearts of the saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#593:9">Page 593</a>   He brings in our Lord Jesus Christ and then "by the <b>love</b> of the Spirit".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#593:18">Page 593</a>   If divine <b>love</b> prompts to give, divine <b>love</b> would prompt to receive.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#594:1">Page 594</a>   I should like to refer to the question again as to "the <b>love</b> of the Spirit", whether it has reference to Him as a divine Person, or as a feature of the Spirit in the saints?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#594:5">Page 594</a>   The Spirit does <b>love</b>, because the Spirit is God, and God is <b>love</b>, and we need not leave out that thought surely; but I should suppose that Paul was thinking of the <b>love</b> that the Spirit produces.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#594:6">Page 594</a>   A divine Person who is here and dwelling in the saints is a Person who loves and therefore is producing an animating cause for <b>love</b> in those in whom He dwells, and this chapter reminds us very definitely that christianity is a matter of persons, not a system of teaching as people think.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#598:13">Page 598</a>   We are quite clear and in a known relationship, everything having been cleared up; our <b>love</b> goes out to Him and we desire to be for Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac31.htm#598:17">Page 598</a>   In the activity of His <b>love</b> He comes to His own; and what happens when He comes to them must be realised.<br>
<h3>Volume 32 - Miscellaneous Ministry on the New Testament Corinthians-Colossians</h3>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#4:13">Page 4</a>   It is made known in the gospels, we might say, which present the varied characters of <b>love</b> He has assumed on behalf of His saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#4:21">Page 4</a>   The varied characters of <b>love</b> which He delights to wear and in which He delights to serve us are all set forth in His name.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#17:2">Page 17</a>   We have been reading lately of the treasures of the house of God, and we have had before us now how wisdom fills the treasuries of those who <b>love</b> her.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#29:14">Page 29</a>   We are to realise that Christ was actually sacrificed; that is, there was not the slightest toleration of evil when Christ took the judgment of it upon Himself in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#30:14">Page 30</a>   The apostle, no doubt, yearned over this man, and this man was liable to be swallowed up by excessive grief (how we should <b>love</b> to see that!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#34:2">Page 34</a>   We are to "pursue righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart" (verse 22).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#34:8">Page 34</a>   Righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace, are bound up with the practical recognition of our divine bond with all saints as members of one another in Christ's body, and as built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#34:10">Page 34</a>   This necessitates much individual exercise, for if I am not pursuing righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace, how shall I be able to discern others who are doing so in dependence upon, and desiring loyalty to, the Lord?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#39:9">Page 39</a>   I am sure that as saints walk according to  2 Timothy 2:22 , and come together responsive to the Lord's <b>love</b>, they will know what it is to be in assembly, and to taste largely, through His marvellous grace, of assembly privilege.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#41:7">Page 41</a>   But I think we should conclude from Scripture that the work of the Spirit at the end would not be on the line of re-establishing the Corinthian order so much as bringing about personal attachment to Christ and <b>love</b> to the brethren, so that all that is vitally characteristic of the assembly should be found here.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#41:10">Page 41</a>   Not a restoration of assembly status, but a revival of Christ in the affections of His saints, leading to <b>love</b> of the brethren.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#45:2">Page 45</a>   If they felt happy to use literally the words of  1 Corinthians 5:13  it would not affect my <b>love</b> for them or my fellowship with them, because I trust that  in mind and spirit  my brethren feel, and desire to own, the ruin as much as I do.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#46:3">Page 46</a>   Those who do not agree with the way in which this exercise is sought to be expressed may surely in brotherly <b>love</b> respect the exercise and bear with it.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#54:2">Page 54</a>   In the embrace of that <b>love</b> he is prepared to throw everything else overboard.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#58:16">Page 58</a>   It is a cup into which we drink, filled with all the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#58:21">Page 58</a>   It was His portion as Man on earth and thus His cup -- unbroken joy in the <b>love</b> of God, His own personal portion, as He says, "That they may have my joy fulfilled in them" ( John 17:13 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#68:25">Page 68</a>   Is verse 32 what the Lord would <b>love</b>?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#69:4">Page 69</a>   We are always coming up against things that are difficult to us; but then it is the discipline of the Father's <b>love</b>, the very thing that is going to lift me up.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#69:14">Page 69</a>   The enjoyment of the <b>love</b> of divine Persons is sweeter and greater than anything we could enjoy naturally.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#70:21">Page 70</a>   <b>Love</b> is the great building power<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#71:1">Page 71</a>   A man full of divine <b>love</b> would edify those he comes in contact with more than a man full of knowledge.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#71:3">Page 71</a>   Why does it say, "If any one <b>love</b> God,  he  is known of him"?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#71:11">Page 71</a>   He speaks in the Old Testament of "thousands of them that <b>love</b> me", even in Israel, and in Elijah's time He had seven thousand.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#71:27">Page 71</a>   It is a very precious thought that God has come out in His beloved Son; and we are so affected by it that we respond to Him and we <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#72:20">Page 72</a>   Knowledge will not bring me there, but <b>love</b>  will .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#73:5">Page 73</a>   It all comes from Him in <b>love</b> and goes back to Him in <b>love</b>, but it is through the Lord Jesus that it comes to us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#73:22">Page 73</a>   Christ has come into the place of manhood that He might mediate to men all the grace and <b>love</b> of God, and that He might be the Revealer of the Father.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#76:1">Page 76</a>   Paul speaks in the opening verse of  1 Corinthians 8  of the contrast between knowledge and <b>love</b>, and it is important to note this.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#76:3">Page 76</a>   "But if any one <b>love</b> God,  he  is known of him".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#76:5">Page 76</a>   "If any one <b>love</b> God,  he  is known of him": there is something there that God can recognise; God can only truly delight in a nature that suits Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#76:10">Page 76</a>   He has made Himself known as the Justifier and the Deliverer; He has given us the Holy Spirit, who has shed abroad His <b>love</b> in our hearts and who witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#76:11">Page 76</a>   The result is that we <b>love</b> Him; God gets a place in our affections.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#76:13">Page 76</a>   The apostle is referring to those who <b>love</b> God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#76:14">Page 76</a>   There is on earth a company, the product of divine <b>love</b>, to whom the blessed God has become an object of affection.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#77:1">Page 77</a>  We may never have given God the place due to Him, but if we were to take into account who He is, and what His nature is, and how He proposes to satisfy His <b>love</b>, we would <b>love</b> Him with all our heart!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#77:2">Page 77</a>  It is important to weigh the words in verse 6; it is not there what God is in Himself, but what He has become to those who <b>love</b> Him: "To us there is one God, the Father, of whom all things, and  we  for him".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#77:3">Page 77</a>   This involves the whole delight of God in man, the making known of His <b>love</b> to us, and His proposal to find His delight in us eternally -- " We  for him".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#77:4">Page 77</a>   "Of whom all things" brings God before us as the blessed One who originated thoughts for His own pleasure before even He commenced the work of creation, which had in view the satisfaction of the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#77:5">Page 77</a>   All that He proposed utterly failed in connection with the first man and his race -- all broke down; sin and death came in; but that could not change what was originally in the thought of God: He could not give up the satisfaction of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#77:9">Page 77</a>   The realisation in our souls that we are necessary for the delight of the <b>love</b> of God would give us to be marked by great dignity.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#77:11">Page 77</a>   "Of whom all things" -- everything that will satisfy the <b>love</b> of God is of Himself -- and then the wonderful words are added, " We  for him".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#77:13">Page 77</a>   This is the one God who is held in affectionate regard by those who <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#77:14">Page 77</a>  It is in that character that we <b>love</b> Him; we hold Him in our affections as the One who has proposed to satisfy His own heart of <b>love</b> to the full<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#78:1">Page 78</a>   Men are necessary for this; He must have men; no other order of being, however exalted, could satisfy the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#78:2">Page 78</a>   And we are those who have been called and brought to the knowledge of God through grace so that we might afford Him that peculiar satisfaction which His <b>love</b> seeks.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#78:5">Page 78</a>   Every position in which divine <b>love</b> has set us is for the satisfaction of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#78:8">Page 78</a>   He is the Originator of every purpose and counsel of <b>love</b>, but the Son became Man -- the "one Lord" -- in order to effectuate everything.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#78:15">Page 78</a>  The creation of Adam in innocence did not suffice for the satisfaction of the <b>love</b> of God, because it did not bring out what God was in the depths of His nature.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#79:6">Page 79</a>  His dominion is exercised in order that the <b>love</b> of God might be satisfied.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#79:9">Page 79</a>   He has exercised lordship in order that the <b>love</b> of God might be satisfied, and that by Him we might be placed in the presence of God for His satisfaction.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#79:14">Page 79</a>   That will is eternal in its character: it embraces more than the glories of the kingdom; it involves the fulfilment of all that the <b>love</b> of God proposed for its own satisfaction; and will have its culmination in eternity.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#79:15">Page 79</a>  The distinctive glory of the Father is to originate purposes of <b>love</b> -- "Of whom all things".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#82:10">Page 82</a>   In this chapter you look at it; it is a cup larger than any cup you ever thought of, and it contains the <b>love</b> of God that comes to us through the death of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#83:21">Page 83</a>   The blessing that is in the heart of God and in the <b>love</b> of God comes to us in the value of the blood of Christ, that is the side of blessing.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#86:11">Page 86</a>   He took a prepared body that He might give it in <b>love</b> for the assembly so that the assembly might be enriched with all that His incarnation brought in.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#86:15">Page 86</a>   His supper can only be truly eaten in a worshipping spirit, as understanding that He is supreme because of who He is, but supreme in <b>love</b> when we think of what He has become, and how He has died.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#86:16">Page 86</a>   A living remembrance is kept up by those who <b>love</b> Him, but if there is not reverence and worship it is not the Lord's supper at all.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#87:12">Page 87</a>   The way you learn the <b>love</b> of God is in Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#87:21">Page 87</a>   I think the Lord recognises a company on earth who <b>love</b> Him and cherish His company -- "I am coming to you".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#90:16">Page 90</a>   <b>Love</b> is infinitely wise, and there is no better means than the Lord's supper to bring this about.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#91:11">Page 91</a>   It is not Christ after the flesh that we call to mind, it is a living Christ known in <b>love</b> which has been expressed in death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#92:9">Page 92</a>   He says, 'Now I want the saints of the assembly to call Me to mind in that manner'; we come into the apprehension of the <b>love</b> of the Christ that we know.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#96:13">Page 96</a>   His <b>love</b> and what He is for the assembly has been expressed in death but He lives in all the strength of it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#96:14">Page 96</a>   He is called to mind as the perpetuation of that <b>love</b>, though absent and risen.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#96:15">Page 96</a>  The assembly is not to think of Him collectively in any smaller measure of <b>love</b> than was set forth in His death, and it can never think of Him in a greater measure, but the <b>love</b> that is thought of is a present <b>love</b>, a living <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#97:1">Page 97</a>   He says, as it were, 'The <b>love</b> expressed in My death was Myself and it is living in Me now'.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#97:2">Page 97</a>   He will never express that <b>love</b> in the same way again but it will never be less than it was then.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#101:5">Page 101</a>   The whole company calls Him to mind in the reality of His great service of <b>love</b> so that every mind is filled with Him as He is now in the presence of God, having devoted His body and His blood for the assembly!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#101:9">Page 101</a>   It is for <b>love</b> to be on the alert, to be ready to say, "The voice of my beloved!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#101:13">Page 101</a>   He is able to come in a spiritual way to us if we are ready to receive Him in the truth of His present <b>love</b> to the assembly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#103:3">Page 103</a>   His life in flesh has terminated in a wondrous way of <b>love</b>, for it has been given up for His own, and even those who had known Him according to flesh would know Him thus no longer.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#103:5">Page 103</a>   They called Him to mind as having passed by death out of that condition, and as disclosing His <b>love</b> to them in doing so, but as living in relation to them in the preciousness of that <b>love</b> though absent from the world.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#103:6">Page 103</a>   If we call Him to mind, it is as He is now, absent from the world, but known in the <b>love</b> in which He gave Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#103:12">Page 103</a>   Christ effected all this when here, and what He effected remains, and the assembly now calls Him to mind as the absent One whose <b>love</b> effected it all, but who is now in a most blessed relationship of <b>love</b> to the assembly, though absent<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#104:1">Page 104</a>   The emblems represent the body and blood of the Lord: He used His body and His blood to give expression to His <b>love</b>, but His <b>love</b> has achieved Its purpose, and the assembly calls Him to mind as living for her in all the reality of His present <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#104:5">Page 104</a>   What pains His <b>love</b> took to assure them that the night of death had passed, and that there was a morning without clouds, and that He was the Light of that morning!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#106:12">Page 106</a>   We think that if we go on well as individuals that is all that is required, but there is more, we must show <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#106:13">Page 106</a>   Drinking into one Spirit (verse 13); really the Spirit of Christ is <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#106:21">Page 106</a>   If discipline is done in a hard, legal kind of way it fails of its object because <b>love</b> is not in it<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#107:3">Page 107</a>   What the apostle is working for all through is the vitality of the body, and the vitality of the body is <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#108:10">Page 108</a>   If there is a part of the body which lacks honour, it becomes our privilege to clothe it with all the thoughts of divine <b>love</b> which will much more than compensate for any seeming lack of honour in the divine ordering.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#108:11">Page 108</a>   But then on the other hand, the comely and prominent member needs to be reminded that without <b>love</b> he has nothing and is nothing.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#108:12">Page 108</a>   The gifts are all to be accompanied by <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#108:13">Page 108</a>   It is <b>love</b> that gives stature.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#108:15">Page 108</a>  There was much gift at Corinth -- they came behind in no gift -- but there was a lack of the binding, wrapping power of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#108:16">Page 108</a>   The real power of ministry is <b>love</b> marking the vessel of gift.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#108:18">Page 108</a>   But the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, is God operating here not only in power but in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#108:20">Page 108</a>   The Lord's supper has shown how divine <b>love</b> is operating, and the Spirit has come in as a result of that operating<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#109:2">Page 109</a>   But they are all movements in <b>love</b> because they are for the expression of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#109:4">Page 109</a>   The body is for spiritual manifestations, but they are given in <b>love</b> or God is not in them at all.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#116:4">Page 116</a>   The less honourable saints are, in regard to the time gifts, the more important does it become that they should be governed by <b>love</b>, which never fails.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#116:5">Page 116</a>   <b>Love</b> will preserve us from any division in the body: it would seem that the members have the same care every one for another.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#116:7">Page 116</a>   Spiritual manifestations are subordinate to <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#116:8">Page 116</a>   So that if I feel I am less honourable than others in the line of spiritual manifestations, I must lay myself out to excel on the line of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#119:4">Page 119</a>   All that is wanted is <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#119:9">Page 119</a>   The Lord remembered, the will of God, the <b>love</b> of God, the Lord coming to His own, leading to God and the Father.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#120:3">Page 120</a>   The <b>love</b> of God will be the moving spring of everything in a coming day.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#120:4">Page 120</a>   At the present time the great exercise of <b>love</b> is to edify, it is for building up.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#120:17">Page 120</a>  <b>Love</b> would be always thinking of the good of others.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#122:8">Page 122</a>   So chapter 13 comes in to show us that <b>love</b> is the life of the body.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#122:9">Page 122</a>   And this is not the 'invisible church', as people say, it is a body composed of men and women in Corinth, and many other places, all being vehicles for the manifestation of the Spirit and for the activities of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#122:13">Page 122</a>   Chapter 13 tells us that we are not to be emulous of others; <b>love</b> would never want to take the place which another has.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#147:11">Page 147</a>   What marks the new creation is <b>love</b>, and what preserves it is holiness: the divine energy of <b>love</b> carrying everything according to God and holiness preserving from everything evil.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#147:13">Page 147</a>   <b>Love</b> is the active power of holiness now.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#159:9">Page 159</a>   All the cares and pressure do not take us out of the sense of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#159:10">Page 159</a>   I think that the result of the intercession of Christ is that we are kept in the happy sense of the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#176:9">Page 176</a>   How precious this must have been to Him who had given Himself in order to secure a company who should <b>love</b> one another as He had loved them!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#176:10">Page 176</a>  <b>Love</b> to one another was in no sense a rival to affection for Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#176:11">Page 176</a>   It was rather the witness of true <b>love</b> for Him that they kept His commandment to <b>love</b> one another ( John 14:15 , 21).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#177:3">Page 177</a>  When they were in the land, the inheritance bestowed in the <b>love</b> of God upon His chosen and called people yielded wealth for tithes, for offerings, for gifts to those "treasuries" which had so definite a place in the house of Jehovah ( 1 Chronicles 28:11 , 12).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#177:8">Page 177</a>   There could not be any disparity, or incongruity in character, between the <b>love</b> that gives in divine Persons and the <b>love</b> which that <b>love</b> begets in the children of God, and which prompts their giving.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#177:10">Page 177</a>   And the first difficulty which arose in the assembly was in connection with the ministration of that bounty which the <b>love</b> of the disciples made available -- a ministration which needed men "full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom" ( Acts 6:3 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#178:7">Page 178</a>   The Lord would leave it in the hands of those whose <b>love</b> was expressed in it; they could be trusted to act suitably as to detail without precise commandments.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#179:4">Page 179</a>   And we can surely see that this is according to the <b>love</b> and liberty of the dispensation.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#180:6">Page 180</a>   There had been complete self-dedication, and "this grace also" of giving abounded as a result; it proved the genuineness of <b>love</b>; it was the evidence of the presence of elements of a profoundly spiritual character.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#183:2">Page 183</a>   The Lord loves to link with what He has done the precious fruit of it in those who <b>love</b> Him ( Matthew 26:13 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#183:7">Page 183</a>   In presenting His own <b>love</b> and the <b>love</b> of God to us He would not exclude our <b>love</b>; He would rather call it into lively activity.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#184:6">Page 184</a>   We <b>love</b> to dwell adoringly on the <b>love</b> of divine Persons, and then that there should be opportunity for the expression in a practical way of the <b>love</b> of the saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#184:8">Page 184</a>  The collection is a practical expression of the fact that the saints <b>love</b> the Lord and they <b>love</b> His people and His interests.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#184:9">Page 184</a>   It is out of such affections that everything can be secured that is for the pleasure of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#184:10">Page 184</a>   The whole structure of the tabernacle was the outcome of the willing-hearted gifts of God's people; it all came out of their affections, developed through His working under the influence of His known grace and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#184:11">Page 184</a>   If there is a company marked by <b>love</b> to the Lord and <b>love</b> to the saints, everything that is for His pleasure can be brought about.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#184:12">Page 184</a>   The gift of the Spirit, the coming of the Son of God to His own, His manifestation of Himself, the Father's <b>love</b>, are all brought in on the ground of "If ye <b>love</b> me" ( John 14:15 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#198:5">Page 198</a>   To know Him is to <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#198:6">Page 198</a>   God will never be content until we <b>love</b> Him with all our heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#198:22">Page 198</a>   The death of Christ is brought in immediately, and that is the very way in which the <b>love</b> of God has come to light for us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#201:3">Page 201</a>   We see the grace and faithfulness of God, His righteousness and holiness, and His power, and behind all we see His majesty and His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#203:13">Page 203</a>   It is very much like the <b>love</b> of God shed abroad in the heart; it comes very near to that practically.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#206:19">Page 206</a>   We see in Jesus One who was always thinking about others -- faithfulness to God and <b>love</b> to man -- there was never any consideration of Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#213:16">Page 213</a>   "I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the <b>love</b> of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land not sown" ( Jeremiah 2:2 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#215:1">Page 215</a>   Then the apostle was held by the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#215:2">Page 215</a>   I suppose the <b>love</b> of Christ would be probably Godward, the devoted <b>love</b> which has taken up everything for God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#215:3">Page 215</a>   The <b>love</b> of Christ held him; it holds me, that is the thought, the <b>love</b> in which Christ has taken up everything for God, the removing all the old and bringing in all the new even at the expense of laying down His life.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#215:4">Page 215</a>   It was what characterised that Man; it is all in relation to God, the obedience of Christ and the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#215:8">Page 215</a>   The general bearing of the passage is that old things being removed, the <b>love</b> of Christ comes out in that way.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#215:12">Page 215</a>   The <b>love</b> of Christ is a <b>love</b> that has come out in a particular way, a way that sets aside man after the flesh.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#215:13">Page 215</a>   I think there is a tendency to lose sight of the way in which the <b>love</b> of Christ has come out.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#217:21">Page 217</a>   The <b>love</b> of Christ is that which held the apostle, and the <b>love</b> of Christ holds us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#219:14">Page 219</a>   "Things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that <b>love</b> him" ( 1 Corinthians 2:9 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#220:8">Page 220</a>   The <b>love</b> of God is  poured out  -- it is an energetic word!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#221:24">Page 221</a>   Nothing adds to the kiss; it was the father's kiss that was the witness of the father's <b>love</b>, and the next thing is the best robe.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#223:22">Page 223</a>   I think you see the activity of divine <b>love</b> in this ministry, thus put in Paul; there is a beseeching character about it, a warmth.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#228:20">Page 228</a>   It ought to be a great matter to us that God has a dwelling-place here on earth, where He moves, and where He discloses Himself in wonderful movements of grace and <b>love</b> and blessing and, of course, holiness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#237:11">Page 237</a>   It was really the <b>love</b> of Christ in the apostle.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#237:12">Page 237</a>   It is very edifying to see it in that light -- the <b>love</b> of Christ in a vessel characterised by weakness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#238:14">Page 238</a>   The two things that characterise the saints are separation from the world which rejected Christ, and then their <b>love</b> for one another; they are bound together in holy <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#247:11">Page 247</a>   He begins at the outset by preaching Christ, that He is the Son of God: it is a Man in the very supreme place of <b>love</b> and favour with God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#257:10">Page 257</a>   "Holy and blameless before him in <b>love</b>" is a nature suitable to God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#257:15">Page 257</a>   It is sonship suitable to heaven and to the <b>love</b> which rests upon Christ there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#258:1">Page 258</a>   Whatever offences there had been, they are forgiven; they become an occasion for <b>love</b> according to verse 7 -- "Through his blood".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#261:8">Page 261</a>   All are viewed according to the full thoughts of divine <b>love</b> and purpose.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#265:7">Page 265</a>   The purpose is the purpose of <b>love</b> surely, but the <b>love</b> works in wisdom.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#267:25">Page 267</a>   I have been struck in reading through the Psalms, that David in the Psalms does not speak of God's <b>love</b>, though he says, "I will <b>love</b> thee".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#272:11">Page 272</a>   The Father would <b>love</b> to minister it to us now.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#273:30">Page 273</a>   There can be no greater glory for a creature than to have "the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him" -- the capacity to enter into and apprehend what is most excellent in the blessed God, brought out in His purposes of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#273:36">Page 273</a>   There is no greater thought of God than the glory of God in what He has prepared for the satisfaction of His <b>love</b>, so that we should know what is the hope of His calling.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#273:43">Page 273</a>   It is wonderful that God should have picked up men and so enlightened them as having their place in the assembly that they can speak to Him as entering into all the treasures of His <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#274:5">Page 274</a>    1 Corinthians 2  says that the things which God has prepared for them that <b>love</b> Him He has revealed unto us by His Spirit -- the Spirit has revealed them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#274:22">Page 274</a>   Yes, I think it shows that the great things of God are perceived by <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#274:24">Page 274</a>   It has been said that nothing is so intelligent as <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#274:25">Page 274</a>   The wisdom of Solomon came out in that in connection with the two women ( 1 Kings 3:16  - 28); he knew <b>love</b> would respond.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#274:28">Page 274</a>   So that our stature is in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#274:29">Page 274</a>   It is not in any human ability, nor in any divine gift, our stature is in <b>love</b>; and I do not know any reason why the humblest saint should not be as matured in <b>love</b> as the apostle Paul or John.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#274:30">Page 274</a>   We should never have Paul's gift, but it is quite within our range to be as formed in <b>love</b> as he was.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#280:5">Page 280</a>   On God's part it is a purely unsought activity of mercy and <b>love</b>, for none of us wanted it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#290:9">Page 290</a>   Now what a blessed thought it is that the Father has told Himself out, for there is not a single thing in the heart of the Father that has not been fully expressed; it has all come out in the Son of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#290:15">Page 290</a>   Now, beloved brethren, what a circle of <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#291:7">Page 291</a>   It is a scene of ineffable <b>love</b>, and there is no room in it for anything but adoration.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#291:15">Page 291</a>   Everything else has gone out of the believer's heart but Christ, and the result is that we being "rooted and founded in <b>love</b> .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#291:18">Page 291</a>   may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height; and to know the <b>love</b> of the Christ which surpasses knowledge".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#293:19">Page 293</a>   This boldness corresponds with John's epistle where <b>love</b> emboldens.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#298:6">Page 298</a>   Well, we must not let it fall, we must <b>love</b> and cherish it more than ever, for I think God has peculiar delight in a few poor souls who cherish the mystery.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#299:22">Page 299</a>  THE CROWN OF <b>LOVE</b> Ephesians 3:14  - 21;  Revelation 2:4 ;  Revelation 3:7  - 11 I desire to bring before our hearts the exceeding greatness and blessedness of what the Father would bring us into, not only for our joy but for His own joy and satisfaction.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#300:12">Page 300</a>   I think if our hearts were awakened to the great thoughts of divine <b>love</b>, we should find there was illimitable power, measureless power, to bring our hearts into the crown of the blessings.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#300:15">Page 300</a>   It is greater than any gift; the Father's glory, the Father's <b>love</b>, the <b>love</b> of Christ, lie behind all gift.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#300:18">Page 300</a>   The apostle prays that He would grant them "to be strengthened" by the  Father's  Spirit; that is, the very Spirit of Him who is the Source of all the counsels of <b>love</b>, and it is according to the  riches of His glory <br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#301:3">Page 301</a>   It is "that the Christ might dwell, through faith, in your hearts, being rooted and founded in <b>love</b>, in order that ye may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height; and to know the <b>love</b> of the Christ which surpasses knowledge; that ye may be filled even to all the fulness of God".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#301:6">Page 301</a>   The divine nature, the <b>love</b> of Christ, that is the very crown of the blessing.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#301:9">Page 301</a>   What the apostle set before the Ephesians might have  attracted  but did not  command  their hearts, and so the Lord has to say, "I have against thee, that thou hast left thy first <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#301:12">Page 301</a>   Now, beloved brethren, that is just the history of the church; she has lost her crown, she has lost the crown of  <b>love</b> .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#301:13">Page 301</a>  What is so very interesting in Philadelphia is to see that there is a little company at the end to whom the Lord gives back the crown; they have got the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#301:20">Page 301</a>   The true distinction of such a company as that is the knowledge of the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#302:2">Page 302</a>   And I say, the knowledge of that <b>love</b> is the very crown of the blessing.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#302:3">Page 302</a>   The <b>love</b> of Christ is a secret now, a perfect secret between the heart and Christ; but there is a day coming when it will be made public.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#302:6">Page 302</a>  Beloved brethren, if our hearts are crowned with divine <b>love</b>, you may depend upon it that all the power of Satan and all the influences of the world will be against us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#302:9">Page 302</a>  <b>LOVE</b> WHICH SURPASSES KNOWLEDGE Ephesians 3:19 To know the <b>love</b> of the Christ is the consummation of blessing -- the very crown of christianity<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#303:1">Page 303</a>   The greatest endowment and the highest distinction of the church is that she is the subject of -- she is enriched by -- that precious <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#303:2">Page 303</a>   And God would have each one of our hearts to find its glory, its satisfaction and its joy in the knowledge of that <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#303:3">Page 303</a>   I purpose to bring some of the manifestations and activities of the <b>love</b> of Christ before your hearts at this time; and I trust that each one of us may be profoundly affected as we trace in Scripture a few of the steps and stages of the soul's progress in <b>love</b> which lead on in a path of growing light to the goal spoken of in  Ephesians 3:19 : "And to know the <b>love</b> of the Christ which surpasses knowledge".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#303:4">Page 303</a>  I desire to begin at a point where the very youngest believer may find himself in touch with the <b>love</b> of that blessed Person who is crowned with honour and glory at the right hand of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#303:5">Page 303</a>    Revelation 1:5 , 6 brings before us His <b>love</b> as Saviour.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#304:5">Page 304</a>  Perhaps the majority of those present are assured of the completeness and efficacy of the Saviour's work, but I would that every heart knew better the  <b>love</b>  in which that work was wrought.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#304:6">Page 304</a>   <b>Love</b> is the secret that lies behind it all -- its source and the measure of its value.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#304:7">Page 304</a>   It was deep divine <b>love</b> that would have us clear of every spot and stain.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#304:8">Page 304</a>   If you <b>love</b> a person, you would like that person to be clear of every deformity -- to be free from blemish.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#304:9">Page 304</a>   If Christ has washed us from our sins, it was not chiefly to relieve us, but to clear us in the presence of His <b>love</b> from everything that was painful to His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#304:10">Page 304</a>   And this imposed a necessity upon Him for which nothing but infinite <b>love</b> could have been equal.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#304:13">Page 304</a>   Nothing but supreme and ineffable <b>love</b> could have been equal to such a necessity, and nothing could bear greater testimony to that <b>love</b> than the fact that He has "washed us from our sins in his blood".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#304:14">Page 304</a>  Believer, let it sink down into your heart that there is something greater and more precious than the Saviour's work; yes, greater than the mighty act of redemption; and that greater thing is the  <b>love</b>  in which it was undertaken and accomplished.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#304:15">Page 304</a>   It is a wonderful moment for the believer when the thought of this <b>love</b> first enters his soul.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#304:16">Page 304</a>   Because it is not a <b>love</b> which exhausted itself in what it accomplished<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#305:1">Page 305</a>   It is an abiding <b>love</b> -- a present <b>love</b> -- which is set free by what it has done, so that it is now an unstraitened, triumphant <b>love</b>, for it has removed everything about us that was painful to itself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#305:2">Page 305</a>   And there is a present outgoing of that deep and precious <b>love</b> from the heart of the Lord Jesus towards each one of His own in this world today.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#305:4">Page 305</a>   His <b>love</b> is a present reality.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#305:6">Page 305</a>  I believe the characteristic mark of every one who has come consciously within the circle of Christ's <b>love</b> is that his heart is possessed with real desire to know the thoughts of that <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#305:12">Page 305</a>   The heart is absorbed and commanded by the blessedness of divine <b>love</b>, and would fain know that <b>love</b> in the circle of its own thoughts, and of its own satisfaction.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#305:15">Page 305</a>   To be washed from my sins might satisfy the cravings of my conscience, but it would not satisfy the <b>love</b> of my Saviour.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#305:16">Page 305</a>   It was the thought of His <b>love</b> to make us "a kingdom, priests to his God and Father".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#305:21">Page 305</a>   I am sure that if we get a sense of His <b>love</b> we shall earnestly long to enter into, and to answer to, the thoughts and intentions of that <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#306:2">Page 306</a>  I wish now to say a little on that activity of <b>love</b> in which Christ is our Advocate with the Father.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#306:4">Page 306</a>   The apprehension of this is of great practical importance, for Satan is ever ready to take advantage of any breakdown on our part, and to suggest that we have behaved so badly that we cannot now count upon divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#306:5">Page 306</a>   Satan's object is to deprive our hearts of the consciousness of divine <b>love</b>, and thus effectually to block the way to restoration.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#306:6">Page 306</a>   There is nothing that operates so mightily to produce self-judgment and confession as the consciousness of the fact that divine <b>love</b> is unchanged.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#306:7">Page 306</a>   There is no cessation of the activity of that <b>love</b> if we sin.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#306:8">Page 306</a>   Our sin becomes the occasion of a different kind of activity, it is true, but the <b>love</b> is unchanged.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#306:9">Page 306</a>  The advocacy of Christ is not exercised in a court of justice but in the home of <b>love</b> -- it is "with the Father".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#306:13">Page 306</a>   Divine Persons are now concerned about the one who has sinned, and the object of Their solicitude is that he should be restored to the proper affections and behaviour of one who belongs to the circle of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#306:16">Page 306</a>   If we are brought into exercise of soul about our condition, it is the outcome of the advocacy of Christ, and it is really a witness of the <b>love</b> which is active for our restoration<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#307:2">Page 307</a>   When a shade has come in, and the heart has got away, nothing has such power to move us and to break us down as a sense of the unchanging <b>love</b> of Jesus Christ and the Father, and the Holy Spirit delights to impart this to our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#307:9">Page 307</a>   But if He alone can give us divine restoration it is most encouraging to remember that it is the pleasure of His <b>love</b> to do this.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#307:11">Page 307</a>  Then in  Romans 8:34  - 37, we have set before us the <b>love</b> of Christ as Intercessor.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#307:13">Page 307</a>   Who shall separate us from the <b>love</b> of Christ?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#308:6">Page 308</a>  Now what will sustain the heart under pressure of this kind is the knowledge of the <b>love</b> of Christ -- that <b>love</b> in which He enters into all the pressure, and considers the effect of it upon our spirits, and makes intercession for us as to it all, so that we may "more than conquer".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#308:7">Page 308</a>   As we apprehend this activity of His <b>love</b> we are greatly strengthened to face the opposition.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#308:8">Page 308</a>   There is One in the highest place -- in the place of power, for He is at the right hand of God -- whose <b>love</b> is active to sustain us; One whose hands never get "heavy" like those of Moses ( Exodus 17:12 ), and whose intercession never fails.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#308:10">Page 308</a>   If we lose the consciousness of the <b>love</b> of Christ we become spiritually weak -- we fall behind as did some of old -- and when Amalek assails us we are in great danger.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#309:2">Page 309</a>   They are spiritually weak; they have not enough knowledge of the <b>love</b> of Christ to stand persecution, and when it arises they are very soon discouraged and overcome by it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#309:3">Page 309</a>   May God establish our hearts in the <b>love</b> of Christ that "in all these things we more than conquer through him that has loved us".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#309:4">Page 309</a>  I will now go a step further, and say a few words about the <b>love</b> of Christ as Deliverer.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#309:6">Page 309</a>   "For the <b>love</b> of the Christ constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died; and he died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised" ( 2 Corinthians 5:14 , 15).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#310:1">Page 310</a>   To get the full measure of anything in divine things we must approach it from God's side, and from the standpoint of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#310:2">Page 310</a>   Everything is then seen as the infinitely beautiful, and I may add, the necessary outcome of that <b>love</b> which is the blessed source of all "the things that are freely given to us of God" ( 1 Corinthians 2:12 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#310:3">Page 310</a>  Now what we learn from the two scriptures I have read is that nothing would suit divine <b>love</b> but the complete removal of man after the flesh, and that this removal has been effected by judgment coming upon him to the uttermost in the death of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#310:4">Page 310</a>   But in the very place where we see this solemn judgment of man in the flesh, we see the most wonderful display of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#310:5">Page 310</a>   We could not afford to be obliterated, if I may so say, anywhere else but in the presence of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#310:7">Page 310</a>   It goes in a way which magnifies the <b>love</b> of Christ infinitely.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#310:8">Page 310</a>   There has been a complete condemnation of all that I am morally as a man in the flesh, but that condemnation has come about in the way of divine <b>love</b> -- it has come about in the death of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#310:9">Page 310</a>   Thus we get two things together of which the cross is the witness: the complete setting aside of all that we are in the flesh, and the introduction of the <b>love</b> of Christ as a new motive principle -- a new moral centre -- in the heart of the Christian.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#310:11">Page 310</a>   He does not look at things from the point of view of the importance of self; the <b>love</b> of Christ is now his starting-point -- it is that which constrains him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#310:12">Page 310</a>   In the presence of divine <b>love</b> we know our nothingness, and we can afford to 'pour contempt on all our pride'.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#310:13">Page 310</a>   When the <b>love</b> of the Christ is thus known in its constraining power, there is practical deliverance from all the weak and beggarly elements of legality which after all only retain self, and minister to the importance and satisfaction of the man who has gone for God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#311:9">Page 311</a>   And such a one would rejoice to be able to change his standpoint, and to look at things from the side of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#311:11">Page 311</a>   And he would then learn, as we have seen, that the flesh is set aside in the way of divine <b>love</b>, and that there is another Man before God, filling His eye and heart with unspeakable rest and satisfaction, and that the blessings and grace of christianity are all set forth in Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#311:16">Page 311</a>  We will now turn to a scripture in which the <b>love</b> of Christ as Sanctifier is brought before us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#312:1">Page 312</a>   Here we see another of those wondrous activities in which the <b>love</b> of Christ is known.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#312:2">Page 312</a>   He has become the Sanctifier that He might introduce His own to complete association with Himself, in a <b>love</b> which '.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#312:6">Page 312</a>   ( Hymn 249 ) It is the blessed thought of the <b>love</b> of Christ that His own should be "all of one" with Himself, and if our hearts are attracted by this <b>love</b>, there is no lack of power to bring us consciously into it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#312:9">Page 312</a>   To the end of verse 9 it is grace, but verses 10 - 12 are the thoughts of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#312:11">Page 312</a>   It is the pleasure of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#312:13">Page 312</a>   It is that holy scene where divine <b>love</b> has its supreme satisfaction and rest.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#312:17">Page 312</a>   There may be favour in it but there is no <b>love</b>, for they are not at home in the place to which they are introduced; they do not belong to the place.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#312:19">Page 312</a>   Divine <b>love</b> has measured all that was involved in this, all that was necessary to bring it about, and has accomplished it all.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#312:20">Page 312</a>   It is not only that grace has perfectly met our need and our responsibility here, but divine <b>love</b> has given us an entirely new origin<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#313:1">Page 313</a>   The death of Christ is not only the end of everything that we were as in the flesh, but it is that from which we have derived our origin as a race who know the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#313:3">Page 313</a>   The fruit of the death of Christ is a race who know the <b>love</b> of God which has displayed itself in that death; it is a race begotten by the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#313:4">Page 313</a>   Christ has gone into death that He might be the Origin of a company deriving everything from Himself -- a company of "many sons" knowing the blessed and perfect <b>love</b> of God, and at home in that <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#313:10">Page 313</a>   He has declared His Father's name to His brethren that we may enter into all the blessedness of the <b>love</b> which rests upon Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#313:11">Page 313</a>   "That the <b>love</b> with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them" ( John 17:26 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#313:12">Page 313</a>  Then, on the other hand, none but Himself could give a suited response to the <b>love</b> into which He has brought us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#313:16">Page 313</a>   It is a wonderful thought of divine <b>love</b> that Christ should become the Centre of a sanctified company capable of appreciating the Father's name, and capable of being in harmony with the song which only Christ can sing -- a song which is the suited and adequate response to all the fulness of the revelation of God<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#314:2">Page 314</a>  Just a few words in conclusion on the scripture to which I alluded before, where the apostle prays that the saints might "know the <b>love</b> of the Christ which surpasses knowledge" ( Ephesians 3:19 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#314:5">Page 314</a>  We must be strengthened with power by the Father's Spirit in the inner man; Christ must dwell in our hearts by faith; and we must be rooted and founded in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#314:7">Page 314</a>   But in that universe of bliss the assembly has her own peculiar and distinctive portion in the <b>love</b> of the Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#314:8">Page 314</a>   She will be the satisfaction of His heart for ever, and His <b>love</b> will be her satisfaction and her inalienable portion.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#314:10">Page 314</a>   And Paul would have us to anticipate the glory -- to enter even while here into the peculiar distinction of the assembly -- to "know the <b>love</b> of the Christ which surpasses knowledge".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#314:12">Page 314</a>   May God greatly affect our hearts by the consideration of it, and bring each one of us more under the present influence of the <b>love</b> of the Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#316:2">Page 316</a>   It is the assembly viewed according to the counsels of infinite <b>love</b>, and viewed as an entirely unmixed spiritual product of the work of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#317:14">Page 317</a>   The fulness of God is, of course, of fathomless depth, but is that which is adequate to bring out all that God is morally and in the counsels of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#317:32">Page 317</a>   The assembly is the vessel in which the power of God works, so that there may be an apprehension of God in His great thoughts of <b>love</b>, and particularly manward -- as men, and not angels, may know Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#318:12">Page 318</a>   It speaks of the <b>love</b> of the Christ, the fulness and the glory in these verses.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#318:19">Page 318</a>   Then there is the rooting and founding in <b>love</b>, and the apprehension of the breadth and length and depth and height (that is, the vast universe of bliss, as we speak); then the Centre of it in the <b>love</b> of the Christ which surpasses knowledge; then "filled even to all the fulness of God".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#320:3">Page 320</a>   Then we are set along with the brethren where these qualities are needed, "lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, bearing with one another in <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#324:13">Page 324</a>   We want the <b>love</b> of it and the faith of it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#326:5">Page 326</a>   "He that abides in <b>love</b> abides in God, and God in him", John says ( 1 John 4:16 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#337:3">Page 337</a>   And this is to be held in <b>love</b>, it is not a system of theology.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#337:12">Page 337</a>   "Holding the truth in <b>love</b>", what does that mean?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#337:16">Page 337</a>   It has been said that is '<b>love</b> in activity', and it is really in the divine nature that the truth can be spiritually held, in a nature kindred with God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#337:18">Page 337</a>   Is that why Paul breaks off in a kind of parenthesis in the great chapter of <b>love</b> in Corinthians?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#337:21">Page 337</a>   Yes, it is what gives vitality to things; truth without <b>love</b> is very cold and barren.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#337:28">Page 337</a>   Verses 13 and 15 would show this chapter is for setting forth things in <b>love</b> and intelligence; we have been a bit lopsided in them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#337:31">Page 337</a>   The great point here is growing, "We may grow up to him in all things, who is the head, the Christ: from whom the whole body, fitted together, and connected by every joint of supply, according to the working in its measure of each one part, works for itself the increase of the body to its self-building up in <b>love</b>", which brings us back to the divine nature<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#339:8">Page 339</a>   works for itself the increase of the body to its self-building up in <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#339:17">Page 339</a>   So there is a power of self-building up in <b>love</b> that is even greater than the action of gifts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#341:25">Page 341</a>   The life of God is the activity of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#341:26">Page 341</a>   If we are really enlightened as to God, and our natural ignorance removed, and light has come into the mind, we see that the life of God is <b>love</b> in activity.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#342:2">Page 342</a>  If we really understood that the life of God was the activity of <b>love</b>, we should see what a degrading thing it is to be governed by selfishness and self-gratification; so that we should be prepared to cast it aside as an unworthy life, unworthy of creatures of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#357:4">Page 357</a>   We are to be as beloved children and then to walk in <b>love</b> "even as the Christ loved us".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#357:23">Page 357</a>  "Walk in <b>love</b>" brings in something higher than this.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#357:27">Page 357</a>   A saint suffering in <b>love</b> takes on that character before God, would you say<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#359:2">Page 359</a>   Does it go with what is expressed in  1 John 4:12 , "If we <b>love</b> one another, God abides in us, and his <b>love</b> is perfected in us"?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#359:7">Page 359</a>   We are to be children of light and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#359:9">Page 359</a>   Yes, I thought there was a flame about <b>love</b>, as we get at the end of the Song of Solomon.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#360:24">Page 360</a>   Yes, and <b>love</b> delights to address Him thus.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#363:2">Page 363</a>  It has come to pass already for us; infinite <b>love</b> has brought us into the shining of Christ, and just as the glory will be seen on Jerusalem, it is seen on the saints of the assembly in the fact that they appear as light in the Lord and as children of light.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#364:12">Page 364</a>   Well, we have only to keep where divine <b>love</b> has set us and we shall be like that.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#367:1">Page 367</a>   The thought of walking is referred to three times in this paragraph: "Walk in <b>love</b>", "Walk as children of light", and now, "See therefore how ye walk carefully".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#367:18">Page 367</a>   We prefer the <b>love</b> side to the light.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#388:14">Page 388</a>   In chapter 1 you have the "surpassing greatness of his power", in chapter 2 the "surpassing riches of his grace", and in chapter 3 the <b>love</b> of the Christ which "surpasses knowledge".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#390:23">Page 390</a>   The saints are put together in this epistle, "that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts"; and it goes on to speak of the whole company entering into it: "That ye may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height; and to know the <b>love</b> of the Christ which surpasses knowledge".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#391:21">Page 391</a>   This epistle would show that, and we <b>love</b> them always from that point of view; they are essential for the bringing in of all this.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#391:23">Page 391</a>   There is much in Colossians and Ephesians of faith in Christ and <b>love</b> to all the saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#392:7">Page 392</a>   The young believer has very great thoughts of Christ, and he thinks, 'They <b>love</b> Christ better than I do; well, I would like to be with them'.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#408:15">Page 408</a>   Divine <b>love</b> instead of the lust of the flesh, divine light instead of the lust of the eyes, and divine lowliness instead of the pride of life.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#408:21">Page 408</a>  One man is characterised by the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life; and the other by divine <b>love</b>, and divine light, and divine lowliness<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#409:10">Page 409</a>   We were under death, and that peerless, perfect One came in <b>love</b> to where sin had brought us, so that our history as in the flesh might be ended in His death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#414:1">Page 414</a>   It is by God's work in us that we are found in harmony with His way with us, and the result is that we come out in the blessed character of Christ, and respond to God in <b>love</b> and lowliness and subjection and obedience.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#417:2">Page 417</a>   Think of him with all his natural energy of character, and with all the burning desires of a heart that had been saturated with the <b>love</b> of Christ, and that longed to carry the fulness of the blessing of Christ to every saint and sinner under heaven; and think what it must have been to  him  to be hemmed in by the four walls of a Roman prison.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#420:4">Page 420</a>   He counts that the "old man", who would have rivalled Christ, and who desired to magnify himself, has been reduced to nothingness at the cross; and now Christ is filling the whole horizon of his faith and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#427:7">Page 427</a>   The Christian, as such, desires to apprehend the full purpose of the <b>love</b> of which he is the subject.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#427:8">Page 427</a>   He longs to search the heights as well as the depths of that <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#427:11">Page 427</a>   The whole immensity of the glory into which divine <b>love</b> will bring its subjects rises before his heart, but cannot be expressed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#427:12">Page 427</a>   Christ Himself the centre of that glory -- the fountain of <b>love</b> that passeth knowledge -- and from that centre streams of light and glory filling the whole universe of God with bliss; while "in the assembly in Christ Jesus" God will have the full glory of His <b>love</b> throughout all generations of the age of ages.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#431:2">Page 431</a>   The effect of the ministry of Christ is that faith in Christ Jesus and <b>love</b> to all the saints are brought about.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#431:6">Page 431</a>  If there is faith in Christ Jesus there will be with it <b>love</b> to all the saints: we become interested in the saints, for they are of and in Christ, they are of that order of man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#431:7">Page 431</a>   Faith in Christ Jesus and <b>love</b> to all the saints are the starting-point in connection with assembly privilege: it is a good beginning.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#441:20">Page 441</a>   The prodigal is brought into the embrace of <b>love</b>, into sonship.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#444:15">Page 444</a>  THE CIRCLE OF DIVINE <b>LOVE</b> Colossians 1:12  - 14;  Hebrews 2:9  - 12;  John 14:16  - 20 It is a deep joy to our hearts, beloved brethren, that a circle of divine <b>love</b> has been thrown open to us and in spirit we are brought into the circle of those affections.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#445:5">Page 445</a>   I feel myself much more familiar with  grace  than with  <b>love</b> .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#445:10">Page 445</a>   And then in the next verse we get the translation into "the kingdom of the Son of his <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#445:11">Page 445</a>   It is where <b>love</b> reigns.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#445:12">Page 445</a>   Beloved brethren, I cannot conceive anything more blessed than to be made competent in the divine nature to be associated with His Son in the enjoyment of the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#445:16">Page 445</a>   There is a company of whom Christ is not ashamed; that is, Christ can look upon that company and see them suitable to His own thoughts of <b>love</b>, and suitable to the Father's name, so that He can declare it unto them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#445:17">Page 445</a>   We are made competent for it by being sanctified, by being set free from everything that is unsuited to divine <b>love</b> by the death of Christ<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#446:5">Page 446</a>   It is an immense thing, whether we think of the Father, the Son or the Holy Spirit, that divine Persons are all engaged in making us competent to enter into and to respond to those divine affections of which we are the object -- engaged in bringing our hearts into the circle of <b>love</b> where the Father's name is known, where the affections of the Father rest, in Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#446:7">Page 446</a>  In  John 13  we get examples of there being no <b>love</b> in the flesh; there was Judas -- no <b>love</b> there -- and Peter failed because there was no <b>love</b> in the flesh.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#446:8">Page 446</a>  We know so little of what it is to enter into divine <b>love</b>; we get as far as grace -- and that is very precious, we cannot do without it -- but we want to enter into the circle of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#447:3">Page 447</a>   But He took a divine way to meet it that His heart might be liberated to flow out in <b>love</b> in the accomplishment of His purpose.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#452:13">Page 452</a>   The death of Christ is looked at in the new covenant as giving expression to the outflowing of the heart of God; everything in the way of blessing is the product of divine <b>love</b> and can flow out from the heart of God towards man through the death of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#452:20">Page 452</a>   Forgiving <b>love</b> had charmed and won her heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#455:14">Page 455</a>   So that creation and reconciliation, and the assembly as the body, will serve to bring out the fulness of the Godhead as moving in the activities of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#461:15">Page 461</a>   "That their hearts may be encouraged, being united together in <b>love</b>" (verse 2).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#461:18">Page 461</a>   The knowledge of God in <b>love</b> would give us encouraged hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#461:20">Page 461</a>   "United together in <b>love</b>" is a <b>love</b> to one another because it is a knitting together.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#462:1">Page 462</a>   So that with encouraged hearts and knit together in <b>love</b>, which is just the normal fruit of the gospel, we should be prepared to take in the wonderful thought of God as to the place Christ is to fill in the whole universe of bliss, for that is, I suppose, the thought of the mystery of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#463:7">Page 463</a>   We know Him as acting in <b>love</b>, and He would like us to know Him as acting in this way; that is, the blessed God knows what He is doing.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#467:9">Page 467</a>   His great concern was that there might be conditions with us, our hearts encouraged and united together in <b>love</b>, so that we might be able to apprehend "all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the full knowledge of the mystery of God; in which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge" (verses 2, 3).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#491:5">Page 491</a>   <b>Love</b> could not bring Him back.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#496:26">Page 496</a>   He bore it all in <b>love</b>, so that sin and death might become witnesses of the <b>love</b> of God, and show how intense was the interest of God in His creature.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#503:6">Page 503</a>   Such is the <b>love</b> of Christ that those who hold the Head will be constantly receiving something; nourishment will be ministered to them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac32.htm#507:1">Page 507</a>   If He were on earth He would be the object of faith and <b>love</b>, and to be followed in His pathway here.<br>

<h3>Volume 33 - Miscellaneous Ministry on the New Testament Thessalonians-Revelation</h3>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#4:28">Page 4</a>   If there is a talk of <b>love</b>, there is generally some practical defect behind it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#4:29">Page 4</a>   "For ye yourselves are taught of God to <b>love</b> one another.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#6:6">Page 6</a>   And one very distinct form which His consideration for us has taken is that He has been pleased to tell us what the blessedness of the departed is, while they await the full and final triumph of divine <b>love</b> and power which will invest them with spiritual and glorious bodies like the body of Him who sits as a risen and glorified Man at God's right hand.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#6:10">Page 6</a>   That is, to be brought to taste and know in a deeper and fuller way what the Lord Jesus Christ is: and to know that we, and all His saints, are for ever bound up with Him, to possess and enjoy through Him and in Him and with Him the precious fruit of the <b>love</b> and victory of God<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#8:12">Page 8</a>   The One who told of the great supper of grace, and of the blessed invitings and compellings of divine <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#11:11">Page 11</a>   What far-reaching authority, exercised in the beneficent activity of divine goodness and <b>love</b>, lies in that title -- the Lord!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#11:21">Page 11</a>   He holds them even in death in the power of redemption, in the power of the <b>love</b> in which He gave Himself for them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#12:1">Page 12</a>   Henceforth no other power but His will ever touch them, and that power is the servant of a well-known <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#12:4">Page 12</a>  We can understand Paul's desire to be with Christ, for we know what a sense he had of the <b>love</b> of Christ, and of the unsearchable riches of the Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#15:14">Page 15</a>   Then will the Son of God receive us to Himself, and set us with Him in His own place in His Father's house, conformed to His image in bodily condition that He may be the Firstborn among many brethren, all set eternally in the glory and affections and condition of sonship for the satisfaction of the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#19:10">Page 19</a>   He regards it as one body on earth, gifts being bestowed with a view to its edifying, that it may work for itself the increase of the body to its self-building up in <b>love</b> ( Ephesians 4:1  - 16).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#26:6">Page 26</a>  Then it must not be overlooked that if there has been a terrible downgrade movement affecting more or less all the organised bodies, there has been another movement marked by the following of righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace, and by calling on the Lord out of a pure heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#29:1">Page 29</a>   And we are to "pursue righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#39:8">Page 39</a>   You have a redeemed people, a people who know God in the <b>love</b> of the covenant.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#42:3">Page 42</a>  "God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power, and of <b>love</b>, and of wise discretion", and Paul goes on to speak to Timothy about being a good soldier.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#46:4">Page 46</a>   If we know what it is to be a redeemed people, taken out of the world for the pleasure of God, and have known what it is to be supported by divine resources in the wilderness (we have had flesh, and manna, and water from the rock), and know the covenant, the <b>love</b> of God, so that we really <b>love</b> Him, there will be a great desire to be numbered for the testimony.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#51:7">Page 51</a>   "For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power, and of <b>love</b>, and of wise discretion".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#55:11">Page 55</a>   Yes, it says, "<b>Love</b> one another out of a pure heart fervently".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#55:12">Page 55</a>   I think a pure heart is a heart delivered from selfishness by the knowledge of the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#55:13">Page 55</a>   The <b>love</b> of God gives one a pure heart because it breaks the power of the selfish motives that had governed us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#55:14">Page 55</a>   Nothing will break the power of selfishness but <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#55:15">Page 55</a>   A heart brought under the influence of the <b>love</b> of God is free from all those things that mark the natural man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#55:16">Page 55</a>   If God has given me everything in His <b>love</b>, I do not need to be seeking and grasping after something for myself; and then one can call on God with a simple reference to God's will, with nothing but a true desire to walk in the path of God's will.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#56:15">Page 56</a>   The exercise with us should be to be here for God's will; we are set to pursue righteousness, faith, <b>love</b> and peace; all these things are in the will of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#57:1">Page 57</a>   The snare of the devil is anything that takes us off the line of God's will, and of righteousness, faith, <b>love</b> and peace.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#58:7">Page 58</a>   The men in chapter 3 are clearly unconverted persons; they have "no <b>love</b> for what is good"; they are "lovers of pleasure".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#58:11">Page 58</a>   If people have no <b>love</b> for what is good, what can you do with them?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#59:29">Page 59</a>   We find it all through this epistle: "Faith and <b>love</b> which are in Christ Jesus"; "Be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus"; "Live piously in Christ Jesus".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#61:1">Page 61</a>   Then the contrast is in verse 10: "My teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, <b>love</b>, endurance".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#68:9">Page 68</a>   I could not <b>love</b> the appearing otherwise, though I might look for the rapture to take me out of pressure.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#70:1">Page 70</a>   His unspeakable <b>love</b> claims the utmost devotion of every ransomed heart, and kindles the desire to make Him known far and wide amongst the sinners for whom He bled.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#70:12">Page 70</a>   In the Old Testament, God's witnesses were impelled by a command from  without , but in the New Testament there is also a constraint of <b>love</b>  within  ( 2 Corinthians 5:14 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#74:2">Page 74</a>   What belongs to this age will be broken up and set aside at His appearing, so it would not be possible to <b>love</b> both, would it?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#74:14">Page 74</a>   The slothful bondman who hid the talent could not be said to <b>love</b> His appearing.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#74:29">Page 74</a>   The Lord preserved certain saints; their walk and ways and state of heart were such as to call forth the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#75:8">Page 75</a>   If we <b>love</b> His appearing it is a question of finding companionship, etc.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#83:3">Page 83</a>   We find in this scripture that it is one great expression of the kindness and <b>love</b> of the Saviour God to man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#83:6">Page 83</a>   That is the condition on our side, and the kindness and <b>love</b> of our Saviour God appeared in those conditions; and His mercy appeared, not on the principle of works which we had done, but it is all God's doing from first to last.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#83:8">Page 83</a>   God's object in appearing in kindness and <b>love</b> to man was to introduce an entirely new condition, which is spoken of here as the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#85:12">Page 85</a>   Yes; it is the question of the kindness and <b>love</b> of a Saviour God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#85:13">Page 85</a>   I can look up and see nothing but kindness and <b>love</b>, and they have appeared to make it possible for me to have the death of Christ between me and the world; so that I do not want to have part in the world; and it links us with all that is of God, with everything in God's world; God has a world of His own.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#85:31">Page 85</a>   The kindness and <b>love</b> of a Saviour God has not been taken in by the soul.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#86:15">Page 86</a>   You find they get forgiveness and justification and redemption, all through our Lord Jesus Christ; then suddenly you find the <b>love</b> of God shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Spirit; they have got the Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#86:16">Page 86</a>   So great is the value of Christ and the work of Christ that it frees the heart of God to bestow the Spirit; I can thank God that He has ever thought of such-a thing; God does it, it is His kindness, <b>love</b> and mercy; He could not act in any other way.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#87:11">Page 87</a>   Suppose that one has real pleasure in the things of Christ, that would be an evidence of the presence of the Spirit: suppose one is happy in the <b>love</b> of God and can say, "Abba, Father", it shows that the Spirit of God is there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#88:17">Page 88</a>   He has not yet the knowledge of the kindness and <b>love</b> of a Saviour God; he knows the law and is striving to keep it, but has no power.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#88:25">Page 88</a>   If God has come out in kindness and <b>love</b> through Jesus Christ, that very fact involves deliverance.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#90:8">Page 90</a>   So that the wonderful wealth of it is immeasurable; it is only measured by the kindness and <b>love</b> to man of a Saviour God, and the ability and competence of Christ to be a Channel to us of all that is in the thought of God; and all is included in the gift of the Holy Spirit.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#90:14">Page 90</a>   That is not exactly Pentecost, but it is the character of the actings of a Saviour God in His kindness and <b>love</b> to man, that He would pour out this immense flood of divine power<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#91:3">Page 91</a>   He tells us what we ourselves were; every word of it is true, but then the kindness and <b>love</b> to man of a Saviour God have appeared with this flood tide of heavenly power poured out on us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#91:15">Page 91</a>  When Paul speaks of the <b>love</b> of God being shed abroad in our hearts, it is a pouring out; not a few drops or a trickling stream.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#92:10">Page 92</a>   One has to learn to distinguish between what is of God and what is not of God; we have to go through the moral exercise of having our senses exercised to distinguish between good and evil, and to learn to <b>love</b> righteousness and hate lawlessness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#101:10">Page 101</a>   His motive is <b>love</b> -- His own blessed nature -- and His object is the glory of the Son.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#102:2">Page 102</a>   By the Son of the Father's <b>love</b> "were created all things, the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones, or lordships, or principalities, or authorities: all things have been created by him and for him" ( Colossians l: 16 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#103:9">Page 103</a>   Other scriptures bring the work of the cross before us as accomplished in weakness and humiliation, done, too, in matchless divine <b>love</b>; but  here , in keeping with the context, it is  the infinite greatness  of that work which is brought before us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#103:13">Page 103</a>   He has glorified God; that is, He has brought the glory of God into full and everlasting display while making purification of sins, so that God can take up those who were sinners, and can bring them into infinite blessing, yea, into the knowledge of Himself in grace and <b>love</b>, according to His own counsels.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#107:7">Page 107</a>   Well may we wonder and adore as we contemplate "the Christ, who is over all, God blessed for ever" ( Romans 9:5 ) thus stooping in the humiliation of matchless grace to bring the testimony of divine <b>love</b> into the very place of sin and death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#109:1">Page 109</a>   If the Son speaks, it must be to make known the Father's name and nature -- to declare the Father's grace and <b>love</b> as unfolded in His own counsels of blessing -- and all this revealed according to the measure of the Son, if indeed we may be permitted to speak of  measure  where all is infinite.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#109:2">Page 109</a>   The prophets were "holy men of God", and they "spake under the power of the Holy Spirit" ( 2 Peter 1:21 ); but they could not be adequate to the revelation of infinite grace and <b>love</b> -- in short, of the Father.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#110:1">Page 110</a>   He would have us to apprehend that we are called to the blessing of sonship -- to know that we are loved as the Son is loved, according to those wonderful words, "That the <b>love</b> with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#110:5">Page 110</a>   Of what vast importance is it, then, that we should have Him before our hearts in all His greatness, so that, on the one hand, our hearts may have a true measure of the greatness and blessedness of the revelation of God, and, on the other, we may know the character of the blessing to which we are called, so as to enter into it and respond to the <b>love</b> that has called us into it, that thus we may be to the Father's pleasure and to the glory and satisfaction of the Son.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#113:10">Page 113</a>   Now the Son in all the competency of His blessed Person has undertaken to bring divine grace and <b>love</b> into the very place of the creature's ruin; He has come into the place of sin and death to glorify God there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#114:2">Page 114</a>   But in connection with this the infinite perfection of Christ has been brought into display, and all the goodness, grace, and <b>love</b> of God revealed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#116:6">Page 116</a>   He has under taken in <b>love</b> to set them apart according to the holiness of God from everything which would not suit that holiness, and to accomplish this He has gone into death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#117:10">Page 117</a>   <b>Love</b> will bring us near to the Lord, and then in intimacy with Him we shall learn what His saints are to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#117:13">Page 117</a>   He could say, "I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known; that the <b>love</b> with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them" ( John 17:26 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#117:15">Page 117</a>   All that God is in His nature -- in the activities of His holy <b>love</b> -- has been fully made known by the only-begotten Son to a company made competent through divine grace to appreciate that blessed revelation.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#118:1">Page 118</a>   The music of God's praise is found in the assembly, so that in the midst of a groaning creation and of a world where all is discord, and where everything seems to compromise the righteousness, goodness and <b>love</b> of God, there is found a circle whence melodious praise ascends to Him -- the praise of all that He has wrought and the praise of all that He is in His attributes and nature.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#118:5">Page 118</a>   We are of the sanctified company, and as such are entirely divested of everything unsuited to divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#118:6">Page 118</a>   We are privileged to know our place thus in the sanctuary, and by the Spirit and by the priestly grace of Christ to be abstracted from the world and the flesh, and all things which are connected with our responsible life on earth, so that we may be with Christ as His brethren before the Father's face, holy and without blame in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#118:7">Page 118</a>   Thus entering the holiest we reach a circle where divine <b>love</b> is in perfect rest, and where nothing is seen or heard but Christ -- Christ in His brethren, and His song issuing from their hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#118:10">Page 118</a>   Thus to be in God's holy shrine, and before His face for the pleasure of His <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#121:15">Page 121</a>  But then there is another thing, connected with the purpose of God's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#121:16">Page 121</a>   God in His supremacy is the One for whom are all things and by whom are all things, and He has formed a purpose in His <b>love</b> to bring many sons to glory.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#121:17">Page 121</a>   The fact that He will have sons shows that His purpose is a purpose of <b>love</b>, and glory is the consummation of all that such a Being can propose for His own satisfaction.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#122:2">Page 122</a>   The divine thought of sonship included that men should be in God's presence on the ground of God being glorified in <b>love</b> and holiness as to sin.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#122:4">Page 122</a>   Sonship involves perfect suitability to the holy <b>love</b> of God notwithstanding all that men had been in their former history.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#122:7">Page 122</a>   They are all expressive, and will be eternally, of the holy triumph of God in <b>love</b> where sin had been.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#122:9">Page 122</a>  The sufferings of Christ have conferred upon Him complete competency to bring about the great purpose of God's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#122:15">Page 122</a>   He was consecrated by the sufferings of the cross so as to be qualified to carry through this great purpose of <b>love</b> in a holy way.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#122:16">Page 122</a>   God is entitled to have the full satisfaction of His <b>love</b>, and He is able to bring it about, but He has done it in a holy way by making Christ perfect through sufferings, so that He is seen to be supremely glorious as the One who suffered so that He might carry all through.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#123:10">Page 123</a>   So that while sonship is the gift of sovereign <b>love</b> it is also the precious and eternal fruit of the sufferings of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#123:16">Page 123</a>   "He has chosen us in him before the world's foundation, that we should be holy and blameless before him in <b>love</b>; having marked us out beforehand for adoption through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has taken us into favour in the Beloved" ( Ephesians 1:4  - 6)<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#124:1">Page 124</a>   This purpose was formed in sovereign <b>love</b> before sin or death or even the creation of the world, but God could only bring us into it in a way suitable to Himself through redemption wrought in the suffering of death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#125:2">Page 125</a>   This is part of the great liberation which divine grace and <b>love</b> have secured for us in Christ and through His death.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#137:3">Page 137</a>   But as subjects of heavenly calling we are privileged to know Christ as Priest in relation to God's unchangeable purpose of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#138:4">Page 138</a>   He serves the pleasure of God by representing us there according to the purpose of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#138:8">Page 138</a>   ( Hymn 12 ) When the many brethren are conformed to the image of God's Son in heavenly glory they will actually be in the condition which God's <b>love</b> has purposed for them, and the Son of God will be the Firstborn among them, but He will not then need to represent them in a priestly way.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#139:5">Page 139</a>   It is the most blessed thing in the universe, for it is what He has purposed for the satisfaction of His <b>love</b> eternally.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#139:8">Page 139</a>  I have no doubt the divine thought was that the people should <b>love</b> the priest as the one who represented them, and bore their names as a memorial before Jehovah.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#139:12">Page 139</a>   If we <b>love</b> God we shall <b>love</b> the Priest, for He represents us and intercedes for us as God's elect.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#139:13">Page 139</a>   God would create ardent affection for Him by telling us that He makes intercession for us, and that nothing can separate us from His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#141:5">Page 141</a>   The ability of Christ to save in this priestly way is the expression of divine faithfulness, and it is also the outcome of the <b>love</b> in which He holds a priestly place on our behalf in intercession Godward.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#145:2">Page 145</a>   How it would free them from earthly religion, and set them up in spiritual competency to worship the living God as appreciating His great and wondrous thoughts of <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#146:8">Page 146</a>   We were in the condition of flesh, and in that condition had come under sin and death, and in wondrous <b>love</b> He took up the condition that it might be ended in His death, when He bore the judgment of all that attached to flesh in us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#149:8">Page 149</a>  Revelation is a necessity on the part of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#150:4">Page 150</a>   It seems to me that the privilege of this present moment in relation to the knowledge of God, and approach to Him, of intelligence of His mind and entrance into His <b>love</b>, is so great that it might well move our hearts with intense desire.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#150:7">Page 150</a>   Man was with God in the Person of that blessed One, and before God in all the holy light of what God was as known in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#150:16">Page 150</a>   God would have revelation to be known, not merely by the preaching or by accepted statements in Scripture, but by the witness of the Spirit, so that we have in our hearts the spring which flows from the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#150:17">Page 150</a>   Such is the <b>love</b> of God that He must have believers in the light of revelation.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#151:27">Page 151</a>   There is One who is equal to the bringing out of the <b>love</b> of God and all the thoughts of the <b>love</b> of God, so the One who brings it to us is equal to it; He endears Himself to our hearts as His glory shines upon us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#153:24">Page 153</a>   If I pass through the veil, I come into a region where there is nothing but what is spiritual, and where the soul is free to contemplate all the will of God and the <b>love</b> of God realised and substantiated in Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#154:9">Page 154</a>   The new and living way was the revelation of God in <b>love</b> as brought to us in the death of Christ, but then we have to put our foot down on it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#154:12">Page 154</a>   It is a way paved with <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#155:3">Page 155</a>   He has not only manifested His <b>love</b> in the gift of His beloved Son, but he has given the Holy Spirit as the powerful Witness of His <b>love</b> in our hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#155:4">Page 155</a>   We are assured by a divine Witness of the efficacy of Christ's work, and of the unspeakable <b>love</b> of God as the source of all our blessing.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#155:5">Page 155</a>   There is not a cloud on the <b>love</b> of God, or a spot on our consciences to keep us from enjoying it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#155:8">Page 155</a>   The declaration of God has come out in the death of His Son, who came into death, not only to banish every cloud and remove every spot, but in order that there might be a way paved with divine <b>love</b> over which our souls might travel adoringly into nearness to God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#155:9">Page 155</a>   It is "the new and living way"; it lives in all the blessedness of divine <b>love</b>, and Christ is the One who has opened it up.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#155:10">Page 155</a>   He had to remove in holy judgment all that we were, but in the very place where He did so, He disclosed the depths of the heart of God that we might live in the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#155:12">Page 155</a>   He is the great Centre and power of attraction by whom those who <b>love</b> Him are withdrawn from every rival influence and led into the blessed privilege of approach to God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#156:2">Page 156</a>   He leads our hearts into the holy <b>love</b> of God, and into the vast and glorious purposes of that <b>love</b>, which find their centre in Himself and their circumference in a universe of bliss filled by Him with the knowledge and praise of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#156:3">Page 156</a>  He thus secures a company intelligent as to the mind of God, and knowing the <b>love</b> of God, and therefore capable for the service of God in praise and worship.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#156:6">Page 156</a>   God's house is filled, in the sense that there is a company there capable of entering into His mind and the thoughts of His <b>love</b>, able to trace adoringly the perfection of His ways in Christ, and thus able to give Him now the praise and glory that is due to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#158:12">Page 158</a>   The Son of God has come down from heaven that He might throw the golden chain of divine <b>love</b> round our hearts and link us with Himself for ever.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#172:9">Page 172</a>   Then, again, if we suffer, as many of us do in one way or another -- chastening for sin and folly -- let us not be discouraged and depressed by it, but rather let us rejoice that the <b>love</b> of God is set upon our "partaking of his holiness".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#179:9">Page 179</a>   If knowledge is not used in wisdom and <b>love</b>, we may stumble the very persons we want to help.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#180:9">Page 180</a>  Let us turn to  2 Thessalonians 3:5 : "But the Lord direct your hearts into the <b>love</b> of God, and into the patience of the Christ".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#180:11">Page 180</a>   Being directed into the <b>love</b> of God sets us in the most happy relations with Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#180:13">Page 180</a>   But the same One who directs us into the <b>love</b> of God directs us also into the patience or endurance of the Christ, and that furnishes us with divine capability to stand in the presence of everything that is adverse, and divine power comes out in that way<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#186:10">Page 186</a>   The assembly has departed from first <b>love</b> and is in a fallen state; Christ and the Spirit have lost Their place; and man's will and order (which is really confusion) are seen on every hand.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#187:1">Page 187</a>   There is a call to be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus, to be prepared for suffering, to strive diligently to present oneself approved to God, to shun profane vain babblings, to withdraw from iniquity, to separate from vessels to dishonour, to flee youthful lusts, and to pursue righteousness, faith, <b>love</b>, peace, with them that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#187:5">Page 187</a>   But the condition of the assembly -- the vessel of testimony -- is such that faithful individuals would be concerned rather as to spiritual healing -- that the saints should be found walking together according to truth, and in holy separation from the world, and from everything that is not according to the will of the Lord; that full place should be given to the Holy Spirit and His ministry of the glory of Christ; that the relations of Christ to the assembly and of the assembly to Christ should be known and entered into; that the members of the body of Christ should recognise their corporate bond with one another, and be found acting happily and healthfully in their mutual relations as such; that the joints of supply should be in such living contact with the Head as to minister of His fulness continually so that the body may be united together and increase with the increase of God; that saints may hold the truth in <b>love</b>, and "grow up to him in all things, who is the head, the Christ: from whom the whole body, fitted together, and connected by every joint of supply, according to the working in its measure of each one part, works for itself the increase of the body to its self-building up in <b>love</b>" ( Ephesians 4:15 , 16).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#188:3">Page 188</a>  We are drawing near to the moment of apostasy, and we read of one to come "whose coming is according to the working of Satan in all power and signs and wonders of falsehood, and in all deceit of unrighteousness to them that perish, because they have not received the <b>love</b> of the truth that they might be saved" ( 2 Thessalonians 2:9 , 10).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#190:3">Page 190</a>   I venture to believe that all these exercises, and the activities of sympathy and <b>love</b> in the saints called forth by his sickness, were a sweeter expression of the <b>love</b> and "bowels and compassions" of the Christ than any act of miraculous power by which he might have been instantly healed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#190:6">Page 190</a>   And surely the development and exercise of such affections as these, eternal in their nature, though called into activity by circumstances connected with conditions of weakness and time, are a greater triumph of divine <b>love</b> and power than restoring the sick ones to health.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#192:7">Page 192</a>  With <b>love</b> in the Lord Jesus, Yours affectionately in Him RESTORATION James 5:20 The thought of the Lord's coming would produce a desire for restoration in the brethren; we should want every one to be put right<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#201:11">Page 201</a>   "Whom, having not seen, ye <b>love</b>; on whom though not now looking, but believing, ye exult with joy unspeakable and filled with the glory".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#201:14">Page 201</a>   An unseen Person in heavenly glory has become the Object, not only of our faith, but of our <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#202:3">Page 202</a>   We know how strong are the links of human <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#202:4">Page 202</a>   But a link of <b>love</b> in the power of the Holy Spirit is a stronger link than any bond in natural affection.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#202:6">Page 202</a>   The great mission of the Holy Spirit is to make the <b>love</b> and glory of Christ known in our hearts, so that we rejoice in Him with joy unspeakable and full of glory.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#202:14">Page 202</a>  If the <b>love</b> of Christ is in our hearts, and His glory shines there by the Spirit, we <b>love</b> Him whom we have not seen, and we rejoice in Him with joy unspeakable and full of glory.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#205:3">Page 205</a>   We are under death and judgment, and Christ has come there in <b>love</b> on our behalf.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#205:16">Page 205</a>   In deep and blessed <b>love</b> He has died, and in presence of His <b>love</b> we realise "that one died for all, then all have died" ( 2 Corinthians 5:14 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#205:17">Page 205</a>   His death is the end of all that we were, but it is at the same time the revelation to our hearts of divine <b>love</b>, and in that <b>love</b> we are blessed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#205:19">Page 205</a>   And now we live in the <b>love</b> which has reached us through death, and in the blessings which that <b>love</b> has freely given.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#206:3">Page 206</a>  Thus knowing God we have part in the divine nature, and we <b>love</b> one another.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#206:4">Page 206</a>   "Having purified your souls by obedience to the truth to unfeigned brotherly <b>love</b>, <b>love</b> one another out of a pure heart fervently" (verse 22).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#206:6">Page 206</a>   By the Holy Spirit we are formed in the divine nature -- that is, in holiness and <b>love</b> -- so as to be morally suited to God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#208:39">Page 208</a>   Yes; that is, the believer received complete inward deliverance, being brought to <b>love</b> Jesus Christ and to believe on Him and to exult with joy unspeakable and filled with glory.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#215:19">Page 215</a>   These great principles come out here: obedience, holiness, faith, hope and <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#218:10">Page 218</a>   So that the new principle of obedience (that is, new to man as a fallen being) comes in and brings about conditions that are favourable to the activities of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#218:11">Page 218</a>   People often complain of the want of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#219:18">Page 219</a>   And then we can easily see that that kind of spirit is very favourable to the activity of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#219:19">Page 219</a>   God has provided us with a number of objects for our <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#219:21">Page 219</a>   It is not expecting <b>love</b> -- that is not it at all.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#219:22">Page 219</a>   But there are a number of persons in the world that the believer can <b>love</b> because they are born of incorruptible seed, and he does <b>love</b> them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#220:8">Page 220</a>   "Them that <b>love</b> our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption" ( Ephesians 6:24 ), there is no possibility of being corrupted.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#225:4">Page 225</a>   We are tested as to whether we are prepared to come to Christ as the Living Stone -- as to whether we <b>love</b> Him enough to come to Him who is cast away indeed as worthless by men, but who is with God chosen and precious.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#225:5">Page 225</a>   This coming to Christ is not so much a matter of faith, but of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#226:9">Page 226</a>   Any desire or movement after Him which is awakened in our hearts is but the response to the <b>love</b> in which He graciously presents Himself to our souls.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#226:17">Page 226</a>  " When He drew near to her in <b>love</b> she was too indolent, too studious of her own ease and comfort, too satisfied with her own state and circumstances, to respond to Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#227:1">Page 227</a>   If we have been indifferent, it may be for years, to every approach of the Lord's <b>love</b>, we cannot expect that the moment we begin to have a little desire after Himself, we shall be at once in the full blessedness of His company.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#229:6">Page 229</a>   He not only becomes attractive as the goal to which we press on, but we realise that His <b>love</b> is the strength of our hearts in the way to that goal, and the support of our souls when we have reached it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#230:12">Page 230</a>   How perfect and blessed are these actings of divine <b>love</b>!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#233:5">Page 233</a>  In  Revelation 2  and 3, we see the Lord's judgment of everything that transpires in the assemblies viewed as in responsibility upon earth, from the departure from first <b>love</b> which characterised Ephesus to the self-sufficiency and utter indifference to Christ which marks Laodicea.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#238:3">Page 238</a>  May God bless you in every way and help His beloved children to apprehend the great thoughts of His <b>love</b> in a deeper and fuller way.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#249:26">Page 249</a>   Every desire that Paul expressed in his many prayers would be positively delightful to God, because it was bringing before Him of His own great thoughts of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#255:14">Page 255</a>   God is known as glorious in holiness, and He is moving in holiness according to the <b>love</b> of His heart.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#256:37">Page 256</a>   He is over God's house as Son and as Priest in order to make the thoughts of divine <b>love</b> dominate there.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#257:8">Page 257</a>   It sets forth God as coming out to make Himself known in <b>love</b>, and being known and praised in that light.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#272:35">Page 272</a>   He may have to scrutinise and judge many things in ourselves that are not in the Spirit of Christ, but it is all in His faithful <b>love</b>, and we may trust Him to be faithful; and it is all with a view to salvation.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#292:16">Page 292</a>   Next comes brotherly <b>love</b>: you consider for the brethren; that takes account of everything connected with their interests.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#292:17">Page 292</a>   There are two sides to brotherly <b>love</b>: not only do I take interest in what concerns my brother, but I am very pleased that he should take account of my concerns.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#292:19">Page 292</a>   They are lacking in brotherly <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#292:21">Page 292</a>   Last of all you come to <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#292:22">Page 292</a>   <b>Love</b> is the nature of God; everything is to be marked by <b>love</b> in the assembly, the way of surpassing excellence.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#292:25">Page 292</a>   It is wider than brotherly <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#292:28">Page 292</a>   Yes, <b>love</b> is the spiritual side.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#301:2">Page 301</a>   It is Himself, so to speak; it is "the <b>love</b> with which thou hast loved me" -- not "them" ( John 17:26 ) (though that is true too, as it says in verse 23, "Thou hast loved them").<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#301:3">Page 301</a>   It is that the <b>love</b> with which the Father regards the Son may be in the saints, and the Son in the saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#308:2">Page 308</a>   One needs an education for these things; Peter speaks of adding to our faith; his list begins with faith and ends with <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#313:1">Page 313</a>   Our privilege is not only to be in accord with the kingdom, but to be in accord with what is eternally right, eternally pleasing to God, so that He can rest in His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#313:11">Page 313</a>   There is a circle where God is praised in His nature, His attributes, His ways, His purposes and His counsels, and indeed in the fruition of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#333:18">Page 333</a>   What a wonderful universe it will be when God will be the only object of every heart, and will be operating in everyone, so that it will be a scene of universal <b>love</b> -- and that is the only thing that is right.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#339:2">Page 339</a>  God has been expressed here in the fullest possible way: in His nature and character and in His thoughts of <b>love</b> towards men.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#343:7">Page 343</a>  It has been said that God suffices for Himself in everything but His <b>love</b>, but because of His <b>love</b> -- what He is in His nature -- He must express Himself so that His intelligent creatures may know and <b>love</b> Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#355:7">Page 355</a>   Is eternal life only enjoyed in the energy of <b>love</b>?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#355:20">Page 355</a>   Very good, because in the present economy of <b>love</b> we must begin with what we hear, the mind is arrested and we pay particular attention to it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#363:7">Page 363</a>   Eternal life is the act of favour of God to men, and it is the gift of His <b>love</b> that men should have it and apprehend it in Christ as a present reality.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#363:30">Page 363</a>   The fellowship to which God has called us in  1 Corinthians 1  belongs to the wilderness side; John speaks of a fellowship that belongs to the land -- to the sphere of the purpose of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#366:30">Page 366</a>   We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we <b>love</b> the brethren.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#368:32">Page 368</a>   His motive is <b>love</b>, His moral nature is light.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#369:9">Page 369</a>   They have a loose, casual way of thinking of, "God is <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#369:16">Page 369</a>   "God is <b>love</b>" is that certain persons at any rate have so come to know Him that they can say, God is <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#369:20">Page 369</a>   Light and <b>love</b> are His moral nature and motive.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#369:21">Page 369</a>   What moves God always is His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#370:12">Page 370</a>    He  loved His saints and He walked in the light, and if we follow Him we shall <b>love</b> them too.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#370:13">Page 370</a>   John makes <b>love</b> the great test.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#370:18">Page 370</a>   "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have <b>love</b> amongst yourselves" ( John 13:35 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#370:19">Page 370</a>   It shows how closely light and <b>love</b> come together, perfectly in God, and also in His people.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#370:20">Page 370</a>   But we are never said to be light and never said to be <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#370:23">Page 370</a>   Well, I suppose there is something very absolute about <b>love</b>, but light is relative to darkness.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#370:27">Page 370</a>   <b>Love</b> is what God is absolutely.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#370:32">Page 370</a>   But is must be reserved to God -- <b>love</b> is His nature.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#370:35">Page 370</a>   We should apprehend God first as light, or we should not have a right thought of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#370:41">Page 370</a>   We are more at home with God as <b>love</b> than as light.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#374:25">Page 374</a>   If we did, there would be much more confidence and <b>love</b> amongst the brethren.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#378:14">Page 378</a>   You abhor the sin, but you <b>love</b> that blessed Man in heaven who would be your Advocate when you have said a hasty word.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#381:8">Page 381</a>   The believer's sin requires, and calls into exercise, this gracious activity of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#389:6">Page 389</a>   We should be basking in the sunshine of  a brighter world , and in the enjoyment of the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#389:9">Page 389</a>   As to our surroundings in the world we are passing through, everything is permeated by the influences and principles of man in the flesh, and if we are not careful to keep ourselves "covered" we shall soon find how quickly these influences will steal into our hearts and draw us away from the Father's world and the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#393:27">Page 393</a>   "I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his <b>love</b>" ( John 15:10 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#393:28">Page 393</a>   It was the condition on which that blessed One abode in His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#393:30">Page 393</a>   And if we keep His commandments we shall abide in His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#394:33">Page 394</a>   Are these commands of the Lord Himself, commandments of <b>love</b> coming from One who does <b>love</b>?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#395:3">Page 395</a>   With David's men, he was their commandment, so to speak, for they had such <b>love</b> for him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#395:11">Page 395</a>   Would it be right to say that His commandments are the expression of <b>love</b>?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#395:14">Page 395</a>   His commandments are the expression of what God's <b>love</b> would have us be, but His word is the expression of Himself.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#395:16">Page 395</a>   "In him verily the <b>love</b> of God is perfected".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#395:25">Page 395</a>   We want to escape from our own wills and come under divine control -- the will of the One we <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#396:11">Page 396</a>   The gain of keeping His word is that the <b>love</b> of God is perfected in those that do.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#397:5">Page 397</a>   "If any one <b>love</b> me, he will keep my word, and my Father will <b>love</b> him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#397:17">Page 397</a>   The <b>love</b> of God is perfected.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#397:20">Page 397</a>   It is not an abstract quality of <b>love</b> in God, but as working out in human hearts.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#397:29">Page 397</a>   Yes, no doubt he was lovable and he can speak of the <b>love</b> of God in a very simple and happy way, as one in whom it was perfected.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#397:30">Page 397</a>   It seems rather the thought of the appreciation of the <b>love</b> of God coming to maturity in a man.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#397:31">Page 397</a>  The <b>love</b> of God shed abroad in our hearts is there in Romans, God's gospel <b>love</b>, His <b>love</b> to sinners manifested in the fact that Christ has died for them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#397:32">Page 397</a>   It is like the first appreciation of the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#397:35">Page 397</a>   If we <b>love</b> one another His <b>love</b> is perfected in us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#397:39">Page 397</a>   It is a wonderful thought -- the <b>love</b> of God being perfected.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#398:1">Page 398</a>   "Perfect <b>love</b> casts out fear" ( 1 John 4:18 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#398:5">Page 398</a>   It is God's perfect <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#400:20">Page 400</a>   It is not deliverance we want, but the Deliverer, the Person actuated by divine power and <b>love</b>, Jesus Christ our Lord<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#401:11">Page 401</a>   We know that we have passed from death to life because we <b>love</b> the brethren.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#401:13">Page 401</a>   If I abide in Christ I shall <b>love</b> the brethren, for they are born of God, and in so doing I escape from sin.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#401:16">Page 401</a>  It is a great thing to have brethren that we can <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#401:20">Page 401</a>   But if I think this man was once convicted of sin by the mighty operation of God and he was brought to self-abasement and to see the value of Christ, well, I want to think of him in that way and to <b>love</b> him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#403:4">Page 403</a>   So the fall of man is the opportunity for God to show His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#403:9">Page 403</a>   I suppose there is thus a reason why it should be dwelt upon, because it is man's estate in death and as having committed sins that brings out the <b>love</b> of God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#403:10">Page 403</a>   It is the knowledge of that <b>love</b> that is to be manifested in the children of God, not complacent <b>love</b>, not simply <b>love</b> that moves happily when all is complacent, but that moves happily and victoriously in the presence of the most contrary elements.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#403:16">Page 403</a>   <b>Love</b> is largely obstructed, because we get before us certain things in the brethren that we do not like.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#403:17">Page 403</a>   There is nothing God hates more than sin and death, but those very things brought out His <b>love</b>, they were opportunity for His <b>love</b>.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#403:23">Page 403</a>   Unless <b>love</b> is the motive, there is nothing in it!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#403:26">Page 403</a>   Yes, the apostle goes to a great length in saying he might have wonderful things, but if he had not <b>love</b> he was nothing.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#403:32">Page 403</a>    That  is the kind of <b>love</b> that God would shed abroad in our hearts, active <b>love</b> when everything is contrary<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#404:5">Page 404</a>   God loves to be known, and it says, "He that loves not has not known God; for God is <b>love</b>".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#404:14">Page 404</a>   Verse 17 says, "Herein has <b>love</b> been perfected with us that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, that even as  he  is,  we  also are in the world".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#404:19">Page 404</a>   The beginning of the verse is, "Herein has <b>love</b> been perfected with us".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#404:25">Page 404</a>   The stress seems to be on the person who loves as having been begotten -- on the person who is to show the <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#404:34">Page 404</a>   So we are to do it, not expect it; we are to <b>love</b> one another.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#404:44">Page 404</a>   That is how we prove we are begotten, by <b>love</b> inactivity; it is expressed<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#405:8">Page 405</a>   Would the deep sleep of Adam show that there is vindication of the <b>love</b> apart from sin altogether?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#405:25">Page 405</a>   The <b>love</b> of God comes out in the skins; He does not abandon His fallen creatures.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#406:3">Page 406</a>   <b>Love</b> here is not connected with sonship, but with propitiation.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#406:17">Page 406</a>   "Herein has <b>love</b> been perfected with us" -- we should like it to be true, so that the thing is seen in its perfection in the saints.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#406:23">Page 406</a>   Why is it, "We also ought to <b>love</b> one another"?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#406:27">Page 406</a>   And I think it is very necessary it should be put in that way; there is a tendency to evasion with us, but it is due, due to God that we should <b>love</b> one another<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#407:21">Page 407</a>   Do you think that verse 14 bears out what you were saying of God's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#412:4">Page 412</a>   I <b>love</b> to think that all that is in that Person is for my appropriation and possession.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#419:20">Page 419</a>   The Ephesian side is that the Father strengthens us with power by His Spirit in the inner man; that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in our hearts, being rooted and founded in <b>love</b>, that we may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height; and know the <b>love</b> of the Christ which surpasses knowledge; that we may be filled to all the fulness of God ( Ephesians 3:16  - 19).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#421:5">Page 421</a>   Would you say that the boldness is in the realisation of the knowledge of His <b>love</b> in the relationship in which He has placed us to Himself?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#424:1">Page 424</a>   Jude says, "Keep yourselves in the <b>love</b> of God" ( Jude 21 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#424:5">Page 424</a>   The world is there with all its attractions, but it only appeals to that in me which does not <b>love</b> God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#424:6">Page 424</a>   As children of God we <b>love</b> the Father, and the world has no appeal.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#424:13">Page 424</a>   But if we are really in the <b>love</b> of God, those things do not attract us, and if things come to us in the providence of God we accept them as a responsibility.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#424:24">Page 424</a>   If one has once been turned inside out and convicted of sin, he knows no one else but God could have done it; and the consciousness of the <b>love</b> of God came in on top of that conviction, and we know it was God.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#426:10">Page 426</a>   So our safety is to be kept, '<b>Love</b> divine, near Thee'.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#428:22">Page 428</a>   It is a wonderful commendation, "Whom I <b>love</b> in truth, and not I only but also all who have known the truth" -- a marvellous commendation.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#431:16">Page 431</a>   Yes, so that the saints are objects of <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#431:17">Page 431</a>   It is not only that the Father and the Son are worshipped, but the saints are loved; we do not worship them, we <b>love</b> them.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#431:21">Page 431</a>   So truth cannot be separated from <b>love</b>, so the commandment comes in, "This is the commandment, according as ye have heard from the beginning, that ye might walk in it".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#431:22">Page 431</a>   It would not be genuine apart from that, say if I only <b>love</b> the persons I like naturally.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#432:11">Page 432</a>   The <b>love</b> is incumbent as the result of the truth; <b>love</b> should emanate from the knowledge of the relationship.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#438:17">Page 438</a>   To hold to this is to be maintained in "first <b>love</b>".<br>

<a href="../cac/cac33.htm#466:4">Page 466</a>   In the Person of Christ we see Man beyond sin, beyond death, beyond Satan's power, holy and without blame before God in <b>love</b>, accepted in the glorious place of sonship.<br>

<h3>Volume 34 - Words in Season</h3>
<a href="../cac/cac34.htm#5:11">Page 5</a>   Paul says, "This mystery is great, but I speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly" Two persons becoming one flesh is a figure of this great mystery, and the Christian husband and wife -- the one in his <b>love</b> and the other in her subjection -- are to take up their relationship in the light of it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac34.htm#9:17">Page 9</a>   "And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs"; the upper springs would suggest the region of the Spirit, where divine operations are continually carried on, and the lower springs would speak to us of the affections of the brethren, that circle of <b>love</b> where our spirits are so oft refreshed.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac34.htm#10:14">Page 10</a>  It is a thought of divine <b>love</b> that there should be a natural relationship which serves to illustrate the relationship which will subsist between a divine Person who has become Man, and is now glorified, and the assembly as elevated by divine grace so as to be suitable for union with Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac34.htm#10:15">Page 10</a>   We are privileged to view the present occasion in the light of this wondrous thought of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac34.htm#10:17">Page 10</a>   The assembly being subjected to the Christ conveys no thought of a servile relation; it is subjection to the claim of an infinite <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac34.htm#13:12">Page 13</a>   In His service of <b>love</b> He does everything for the advantage of His wife.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac34.htm#13:17">Page 13</a>  In Ephesians the service of Christ to the assembly requires subjection, not exactly to authority but to the service of <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac34.htm#14:1">Page 14</a>   As the assembly is subject to the service of Christ's <b>love</b> she takes on the qualities of the woman of worth in Proverbs.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac34.htm#14:10">Page 14</a>   That is the model our beloved brother and sister should pursue -- the husband seeking to express the <b>love</b> of Christ to his wife and she brought into subjection to that <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac34.htm#15:2">Page 15</a>   We have been reading lately of the treasures of the house of God, and we have had before us now how Wisdom fills the treasuries of those who <b>love</b> her.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac34.htm#23:3">Page 23</a>  It is a law of spiritual life that <b>love</b> and appreciation of the Lord Jesus Christ must find expression.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#32:30">Page 32</a>   It is the way we know divine <b>love</b>; apart from what is sacrificial I do not know that there is any disclosure of it otherwise, but it is liberating from ourselves.<br>

<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#204:13">Page 204</a>    Ephesians 5:2  says, "Walk in <b>love</b>, even as the Christ loved us, and delivered himself up for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#204:18">Page 204</a>   If it were understood, we should be more ready to give up our self-importance and all that hinders <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#218:32">Page 218</a>   It is the Lord as revealed in <b>love</b> and grace.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#238:14">Page 238</a>   To be with Me to behold My glory, that is, He brings His own to contemplate a glory which was in keeping with the Father's <b>love</b> to Him before the world began.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#238:15">Page 238</a>   What a great service in the assembly for the saints to bring Him in their affections into the place that He has in the Father's <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#242:6">Page 242</a>  'When all things filled by Thee are wholly blest,  And God's deep <b>love</b> eternally shall rest  In that which ever speaks to Him of Thee,  Thy greatness, Lord, the universe shall see'.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#244:19">Page 244</a>   His saints are restful too in His having carried out the purposes of His <b>love</b> to His entire satisfaction.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#245:8">Page 245</a>   Then it becomes the privilege of faith and <b>love</b> to see the wonderful way He has passed by in incarnation, in death and resurrection, and in ascension.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#246:23">Page 246</a>   And in the epistle he applies it to the saints: "No one has seen God at any time: if we <b>love</b> one another, God abides in us, and his <b>love</b> is perfected in us" ( 1 John 4:12 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#250:4">Page 250</a>   And now Solomon has taken the place of David, representing Christ as the Son of the Father's <b>love</b>, glorified in heaven.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#251:1">Page 251</a>   It covers all that God would have to be known as a matter of testimony, all He is in grace and <b>love</b>, and all He has purposed to be known in Christ -- that is God's name, His renown.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#252:9">Page 252</a>   There is no human system great enough for those who <b>love</b> God; they must get into the house of God and the largeness of His blessing in Christ, and that is infinite.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#252:10">Page 252</a>   The house is composed of those who have the Spirit of sonship; Christ is the Son of the Father's <b>love</b> and everything has come in through Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#269:17">Page 269</a>   In speaking of recovery, would it be to first <b>love</b>?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#275:23">Page 275</a>   Worship is greater because sons can serve on the line of appreciating all that God is as known to them in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#277:4">Page 277</a>   There is, of course, very much in the Supper suggesting the Lord's personal <b>love</b> to the assembly, but then it was <b>love</b> expressed sacrificially.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#277:12">Page 277</a>   It is the moral side -- the glory of His will and of His <b>love</b> and what He is in grace.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#286:18">Page 286</a>   In view of these things we should be provoked to more <b>love</b> and more diligence, so that the saints should enjoy the inheritance more.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#288:6">Page 288</a>   We <b>love</b> to see prosperity in God's house.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#288:8">Page 288</a>   But God cannot fail us or disappoint us if we <b>love</b> the habitation of His house and the place where His glory dwells.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#298:18">Page 298</a>   The other side is, as Paul did in this wonderful dispensation of grace, to know God in liberty and <b>love</b>, so that we serve without constraint<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#309:19">Page 309</a>   It liberates us to contemplate an order of things that cannot be improved, and indeed we know what it is to be brought into connection with a scene that is in perfection and with a blessed Person in control, where everything is operating in <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#310:21">Page 310</a>   With the women in the gospels, like the woman in  Luke 7 , and Mary in  John 12 , there was a profound sense of divine <b>love</b> as expressed in Him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#318:21">Page 318</a>   There will be no place in heaven for forgiving and forbearing one another in <b>love</b>, nor if you have a complaint against anyone at the present time<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#330:4">Page 330</a>   We like to think of His power, His grace and His <b>love</b> to poor sinners, but we need to ponder His majesty; it is connected with the throne.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#344:11">Page 344</a>   "If any man <b>love</b> not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be Anathema Maranatha" ( 1 Corinthians 16:22 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#344:19">Page 344</a>   Yes, any christian would admit that the claims of God and the Lord Jesus in <b>love</b> are of such a character that whole-hearted devotion would be the only answer to it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#351:33">Page 351</a>   It seems to me it was more a <b>love</b> of the world<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#352:4">Page 352</a>   Jehovah delivered him from this unholy link with Ahab, by Ahab's death, but He pronounced the solemn sentence upon him -- the prophet met him in the next chapter and challenged him -- "Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and <b>love</b> them that hate Jehovah?<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#355:22">Page 355</a>   Well, those are beautiful features of the way the saints <b>love</b> to honour Christ as the women anointed Him in the gospels<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#356:20">Page 356</a>   And the saints say, 'We are in accord with that' -- how we <b>love</b> to accord it to Him!<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#369:13">Page 369</a>   It reminds one of Ephesus; they did much that was right, but they had left their first <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#369:14">Page 369</a>   "But I have against thee, that thou hast left thy first <b>love</b>" ( Revelation 2:4 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#381:11">Page 381</a>   So the <b>love</b> of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given to us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#381:14">Page 381</a>   So the working out of holiness is by <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#381:15">Page 381</a>   That it is by faith is a terrible delusion, it is by <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#381:16">Page 381</a>   So whatever is inconsistent with holiness is inconsistent with <b>love</b>; it is two parts of the divine nature.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#381:18">Page 381</a>   If uncleanness is dispensed with there is nothing left but <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#381:20">Page 381</a>   Fancy a company permeated by <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#383:30">Page 383</a>   And every one of the Levites should be set for the cleansing of the house, and all serving on the line of developing <b>love</b> in the saints, so that God can have a house where He can be comfortable and be praised.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#404:7">Page 404</a>   The loaf has to do with our relations with Christ, and the cup with our relations with God; but then it is the Lord who in <b>love</b> secures both for us.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#404:13">Page 404</a>   It is wonderful that He should come into flesh and blood that He might use that condition to express His <b>love</b> to the assembly, and He has given His body for the assembly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#405:1">Page 405</a>   The loaf that we break, all that Christ brought into manhood is for the assembly's appropriation, so that as appropriating Christ she becomes His counterpart, a new thing in the earth, a company that has appropriated in its affections all that came here in the body of Christ and is available to the saints in His death; and the precious features that came out in that body are to come out in the saints as a satisfaction for the <b>love</b> of Christ.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#405:14">Page 405</a>   In giving us the cup He has in view that we should be in perfect liberty and joy with God, drinking in in the power of the Spirit what God is as made known in His blessed <b>love</b>, in His nature.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#405:16">Page 405</a>   The first thing is we have to begin with the loaf, so all that came here in the body of Christ has been dedicated in <b>love</b> to the assembly, and is to be appropriated by the assembly, and we call the Lord to mind in that connection.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#406:25">Page 406</a>   We would be freer in the service of praise if we entered more into this; we are slow in apprehending His body being given for the assembly; that is to be apprehended, for there is that on the earth that has gathered up for itself what has come here in the richness and blessedness of it, so that she has become His counterpart for the satisfaction of His <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#407:5">Page 407</a>   It was just at that moment when murder filled all the scene that He brings out what His <b>love</b> conferred on the assembly (for the disciples were that in principle), that is, He conferred  Himself  on the assembly.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#411:17">Page 411</a>   I think that the Lord in His <b>love</b> provides a filling when we do come, but surely we have the privilege of anticipating it.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#411:23">Page 411</a>   We come together as thinking nothing of ourselves, but all engaged with the blessed thought that Christ is the Son of the Father's <b>love</b> and that He is so delightful to God, and we realise we are in Him before the Father's face.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#411:26">Page 411</a>   As individuals it is mixed up with personal exercises, and in the assembly we drop all that and we merge in the company which is blessed in Christ according to the purpose of divine <b>love</b><br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#414:15">Page 414</a>   Paul prays that we may be knit together in <b>love</b> so that we have the full assurance of understanding, as if to say, 'We will not understand anything unless first knit together'.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac35.htm#441:21">Page 441</a>   It is most touching to see the tenderness and fidelity of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<h3>Remarks on a pamphlet by A. J. Pollock entitled "The Eternal Son"</h3>
<a href="../cac/cac36.htm#7:8">Page 7</a>   His Person is unchanged, whatever place, service, or relationship He might be pleased to take up for the effectuation of the purposes of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac36.htm#10:4">Page 10</a>  The more we contemplate the Son of God in His mediatorial position the more shall we perceive the infinitude and blessedness of the <b>love</b> of God expressed in the gift of such a Person.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac36.htm#10:5">Page 10</a>   He has come within the range of men's apprehension as given by God in <b>love</b> to the world ( John 3:16 ).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac36.htm#10:8">Page 10</a>   <b>Love</b> would have been ineffective if He had not done so, and this could not be when the <b>love</b> was GOD'S <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac36.htm#10:9">Page 10</a>   "Herein as to us has been manifested the <b>love</b> of God, that God has sent his only-begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac36.htm#10:10">Page 10</a>   Herein is <b>love</b>, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son a propitiation for our sins" ( 1 John 4:9 ,10).<br>
<a href="../cac/cac36.htm#10:11">Page 10</a>   Our hearts engage themselves believingly and adoringly with the glorious Person of the Son of God; we view Him in holy Manhood, and going into death, and we perceive the <b>love</b> of God, for it was God who gave and sent Him<br>
<a href="../cac/cac36.htm#11:6">Page 11</a>   On the contrary, it brings out fully the wondrous and blessed fact that the <b>love</b> of God is made known to men in the only way in which it could be made known, that is, mediatorially in His beloved Son as Man on earth.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac36.htm#11:7">Page 11</a>   The whole point of the statements of Scripture is to show that the <b>love</b> of God has come into tangible expression.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac36.htm#11:10">Page 11</a>   He was in the presence of Nicodemus when He spoke of Himself as given by God in <b>love</b>; He was before men's eyes all through John's Gospel as the Sent One.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac36.htm#12:1">Page 12</a>   And when the hour came for supreme expression to be given to the <b>love</b> of God, that <b>love</b> to men was so great that He did not spare the One who was so holy, so delightful to His heart, so beloved by Him, but delivered Him up for us all.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac36.htm#18:9">Page 18</a>   But the activities of the Son and the Spirit are both subordinated to the purpose of divine <b>love</b> that God should be known as the Father.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac36.htm#19:1">Page 19</a>   The Son has made Him known mediatorially, and the Spirit is sent and given so that His <b>love</b> may be shed abroad in the hearts of believers, and that they may, as having the Spirit of Sonship, cry, "Abba, Father".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac36.htm#19:8">Page 19</a>   But the Son and the Spirit have been pleased to take a relative place which is not commensurate with Their full Personal glory, but which is essential to the accomplishment of the purposes of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac36.htm#25:7">Page 25</a>   That is a region utterly beyond creature apprehension; and it is our wisdom to recognize that the greatness of God is unsearchable ( Psalm 145:3 ), and to be content with the blessed light which has come to us in infinite <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac36.htm#29:5">Page 29</a>   to give up the "blessed knowledge" that there were Three Divine Persons in eternity "between whom was the outflow of <b>love</b> One to Another, and with whom were divine counsels as to how to bring man into the circle of those divine affections".<br>
<a href="../cac/cac36.htm#33:12">Page 33</a>   Isaac is, typically, Christ as the Son of His Father's <b>love</b>, begotten and conceived in a power altogether above nature; afterwards, in figure, offered up as a burnt-offering, and raised from the dead, to have a wife of His own kindred.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac36.htm#35:5">Page 35</a>   A Divine Person as Man must be perfect in the place and condition into which He has come in <b>love</b> and obedience, and He could say, "My God" as no other man ever could.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac36.htm#44:4">Page 44</a>   She dispenses honour to those who <b>love</b> her, and fills their treasuries.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac36.htm#45:5">Page 45</a>  I do not think that  Proverbs 8  can be understood, consistently with the whole truth, except by seeing that it is the voice of Wisdom abstractedly viewed, but personified as a female who can speak, <b>love</b>, bestow favours, and have delights.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac36.htm#46:13">Page 46</a>   That is, the whole scope of the truth as to God, as it has come to light through infinite grace and <b>love</b> by the incarnation of the Son, and as a result of His death and exaltation, is brought to all disciples now, and they are brought to it, in the sacred formula of  Matthew 28:19 .<br>
<h3>A Message for You</h3>
<a href="../cac/cac37.htm#3:13">Page 3</a>   Sin appears in connection with <b>love</b> that puts it away.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac37.htm#7:4">Page 7</a>   "Herein is <b>love</b>, not that we loved God, BUT THAT HE LOVED US, and sent his Son to be  the propitiation for our sins ",  1 John 4:10  The only-begotten Son of God came into the world heralded by the announcement, "Thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people  from their sins ",  Matthew 1:21 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac37.htm#8:10">Page 8</a>   May the language of your heart be -- 'On the Lamb my soul is resting,  What His <b>love</b> no tongue can say,  All my sins, so great, so many,  In His blood are washed away.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac37.htm#9:9">Page 9</a>   Everything in me was so bad and worthless that I deserved to die, and yet His <b>love</b> was so great that He died  for me .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac37.htm#10:4">Page 10</a>  Many a converted man who has joyful seasons in thinking of the <b>love</b> of God and the Person of Jesus, has times of wavering and doubt when he thinks of his sins.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac37.htm#16:5">Page 16</a>   Where sin brought us, <b>love</b> brought Christ -- even to death; and His death is the end  before God  of all that we were as children of Adam -- men in the flesh.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac37.htm#19:5">Page 19</a>   The believer's sin requires, and calls into exercise, this gracious activity of divine <b>love</b>.<br>
<a href="../cac/cac37.htm#20:3">Page 20</a>   Because we are sons, God has sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, "Abba, Father",  Galatians 4:6 ;  Romans 8:15 ; He sheds God's <b>love</b> abroad in our hearts,  Romans 5:5 ; He makes our bodies His temple,  1 Corinthians 6:19 ; He abides with us for ever, sealing us unto the day of redemption,  John 14:16 ;  Ephesians 4:30 .<br>
<a href="../cac/cac37.htm#34:3">Page 34</a>  ), that they may all be damned because they received not the truth in the <b>love</b> of it,  2 Thessalonians 2:10  - 12.<br>
