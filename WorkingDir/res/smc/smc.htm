Stanley McCallum was born c. 1901 in MacDuff on the Moray Firth in Scotland. As a young man he worked as a cook on one of the many fishing boats in that area.
<p>
Mr. McCallum settled in Detroit and for many years worked for the Ford Motor Company where, in 1947, he and other brothers were faced with the threat of dismissal over refusal to join the union. 
He and his wife, Edna (an American) had four children, David, John, Garth and Mary.
<p>
After suffering from Alzheimer's Disease for some years, the Lord mercifully took His servant to Himself on July 7, 1987.
